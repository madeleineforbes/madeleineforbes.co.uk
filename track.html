  <h3>The Track</h3>
  
    </div>
    <div class="span8"
      
      <p>
     
 <p>The track is scary, at night, even though you must have been down it a hundred times. Past the abandoned fruit farm, vines sagging on forgotten wires. Past the place where we found the wild pig in the wire snare, and killed it to end its suffering. </p>

<p>(That's another story, though, that happened later, so you don't know about that when you get to the damp corner where the stream passes beneath you and the trees drop leaves to turn slimy in the mud.) </p>

<p>You don't know about the pig, and still it is frightening at night. The first part, not so bad. The track there is wide and flat, edged with broom and gorse, tracing the ridge of the hill. The stones and dust are white in the moonlight and your feet tread the way they do in the morning, lightly, and maybe you sing a little, to keep your spirits up. </p>

<p>Later the banks grow steeper, enclosing you. Trees filter out the moonlight, and ahead, as the track bends round to the left and plunges down into the wood, you are walking into blackness. The ruts are uneven here and your feet are not so certain anymore. This is where you start to notice all the little rustles and noises around you. A dog is howling somewhere and you feel suddenly very aware that you are not just a city person, a stranger to the ferns and the brush and the insects, but an alien as well. Whatever creature lurks, whatever form the devil takes to ambush and to bargain with you, you will not speak its language, nor will the villagers understand your cries for help, and you are alone. You have no mobile phone, there is no taxi, no house along the path. None of your talismans work here and it might be as simple as a sprain or as brutal as a stranger, and it will unfold as it wishes, and you must keep going, not knowing what will be. 
</p>

<p>Maybe it is here that you start to feel cold, and maybe you remind yourself that the warmth you generated when you climbed up away from the house has worn off, and the darkness makes the chill worse. There are rational reasons for the shivers down your spine. Perhaps you take deep yoga breaths, as though you can fend off the terror with a technique you learned in a heated studio with a parquet floor gazing out at the Thames. The breaths you take sound loud and you make them as slow as possible, not to sound scared.</p> 

<p>That clench in your belly. No one can see you here and in a way it’s relaxing, the fear, it's not something you can pretend to ignore, like an ex at a cocktail party. It's right here around you and you breathe in the mulchy rotten woody smell and resign yourself, say, yes, this is me, I am here. Do your worst.</p> 

<p>You walk up and past the stone ruin, and as you come down to the right the clearing unfolds like a sigh and the tipi is tall and white in the moonlight, and you can see the van and the yurt. There is no one in them, and yet their forms are welcoming as a dog. Would you run the last hundred yards, not caring anymore, would you hurry to be there with the kettle and the bed and a candle lit, to feel the walls around you and to know you have got to the place that is your home, for now? </p> 

<p>Or would you stroll instead, go slower, on purpose, to strut and crow and silently show: I do not need to be afraid of the dark and empty sky, I am descended from warriors, I would do this again.</p>
