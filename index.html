        <p> <strong>Monday 3rd June 2013</p></strong>
        <p>Can't stop looking at the picture of the four of us all together. Our code is the same and yet I know the differences between us so intimately sometimes they are all I see. But every stranger I met on Saturday said we are exactly the same. I know how their brains work and in what ways they are better than me and in what ways I am better than them, according to rules that only we know. We are all loud and we talk over people and mainly each other, and we are probably the drunkest at a party. We like adventures and foreign places. We are greedy in every way, food, booze, danger, sleep. Greedy for life. Between us there is so much love it's hate at times but really it's the deepest love.</p>
        <hr>

        <p> <strong>How I stopped worrying and learned to love the code</p></strong>

        <p>
          In the UK, git means a cantankerous old man. The US equivalent might be someone you would describe as "ornery". At first, that name was apt. Git and I did not get along.</p> 

<p>I started reading <a href="http://www.gwenbell.com"> Gwen Bell's</a> articles back in the beginning of the year. I watched her website go from a blank page, to snippets of writing, pages. Pages which slowly cohesed, dissipated, rearranged themselves, reshaped themselves into different things. </p>

<p>Wouldn't it be wonderful to watch the process sped up, like time-lapse photography? To watch a site unfurling, growing, changing, the way a bud unfurls? Labour can be painful; the outcome might not be what you expect.</p>

<i><p>The almond tree<br>
was beautiful in labour. Blood-<br>
dark, quickening, bud after bud<br>
split, flower after flower shook free.<br>
<br>
On the darkening wind a pale<br>
face floated. Out of reach. Only when<br>
the buds, all the buds were broken<br>
would the tree be in full sail.<br>
<br>
In labour the tree was becoming<br>
itself. I, too, rooted in earth<br>
<br>
and ringed by darkness, from the death<br>
of myself saw myself blossoming,</i><br>
<br>
(Read the whole poem by John Stallworthy<a href="//puisipoesy.blogspot.co.uk/2006/03/almond-tree.html"> here</a>, to wander down a whole other avenue of birth and meaning and the value of life) </p>


<p>One phrase stuck in my mind, spoke to me, and that was "Digital self-sufficiency". It's tied to the idea of becoming an "active citizen of the web", that is creating the web we want, building it with our hands. The way the first people, the explorers, the pioneers did.</p> 

<p>Before then code seemed to be something slick, noisy, dark. Like a tall windowed skyscraper, thousands of floors, with black windows. And I do not want to live in the tall loud city, made of steel and concrete. I want to live out in the wild, to dig and root in the soil and to grow things from rain and sunlight.</p> 

<p>Digital self-sufficiency. All of a sudden, I saw the code as something else. As thousands of tiny roots and branches, extending out beneath the soil. As fur or feathers or blood vessels, creating something beautiful. Code isn't slick skyscrapers or copper wires, or at least it's not just that. Code is our DNA, is Fibonnaci, the interleaving of scales on a fish, rainbows, tides, an old stone sundial in a garden. Patterns.</p>

<p>I can't quite explain the switch. I'd read about building websites before, and I'd even done a little HTML, but it hadn't sunk in. Now I see the web not as an impenetrable, cold, plastic mass, but as a living, breathing ecosystem that I can be a part of. No longer a passive consumer, scrolling through blogs, clicking from tab to tab, looking for something I couldn't have described. Now, the web is like a problem for me to solve in my own way, for my own purpose. I love problem solving.
