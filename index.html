        <p>Soporific after an afternoon's drinking we wandered back through the village. The fair was closing down and gaggles of sunburned teenagers reeled past, yelling to each other. There was a slight air of carnival, of chaos. I said, I bet loads of kids hook up at the summer fair. You'd say you weren't going - nah man, it's so lame, not this year. But you'd end up there anyway, get wasted and make out with the boy next door, right?</p>

          <p>As soon as we were over the wooden bridge I took my flip flops off. Brand new, they'd worn a blister between my toes. I walked gingerly on the stones, feet tender from winter and that long cold spring. I remember my cousin in Scotland running across the gravel age six or so, soles like leather. My skin is thin. Surfing one year in Croyde, I had to go back and get gloves from the pink surf shack where I hired the board, my palms raw from gripping it where the sand studded the wax.</p>

            <p>Past the last groups trying to get their drunk friend out of the river. On to the meadow. The tractors had finished mowing for the evening, but they'd left a strip of long grass round the perimeter for us to wade through first. A boy went past on a mountain bike, heading for the far village, labouring over the bumpy ground. We stopped and took pictures. The day had been so perfect, I felt nostalgic already. Murray winning, handstands on the lawn and Pimms with mint and cucumber.</p>

            <p>A school of swallows bounced like porpoises along the field. Where the grass had been cut, purple thistles streaked through the hay, bright in the blue-green strands. I walked in an uncut furrow, saving my feet. Dusk came on and the sun lowered as we neared the road, the noise of the traffic got louder. Nearly home. A fat labrador loping in circles by the gate, four kids playing football in the light that was not so much fading as draining away, rosy still. Crossing the bridge the stream was crystal clear as earlier, the budding waterlilies now tightly closed. </p>

            <p>Our second summer in the Fens, and if our manifestations work it could be the last, and so I am missing it already, mourning the loss before it happens. Still I cannot be disappointed. What we have now is all we have, is everything.</p>
