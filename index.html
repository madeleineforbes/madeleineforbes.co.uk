      <br />Hi, I'm Madeleine. Thanks for pausing. Newest piece below; latest ten on the left. 
      <br />

<h4>That's all there is</h4>
<br />
It's the first cold snap of the year. I've been waiting for it, because it means that the sloe berries will be getting sweet.
<br />
<br />After the first frost is the best time to gather them from the dense, thorny spears. They go into a bag, and back home each one is pricked with a needle before being dropped into a clean bottle. Same weight again in sugar.
<br />
<br />Gin up to the top. Leave for three months, and your patience is rewarded with a rich, purple, sticky brew. Best opened after a long dinner, with friends, a stew, or a slow roast.
<br />
<br />Frost, then time and attention, turn the inedible to the sublime. Early mornings, when I leave in the dark, and the road to work is long, have brought me gifts too – sunrises like I've never seen before across these wide fen skies.
<br />
<br />I did that drive for the last time this morning. We're moving. Almost exactly a year ago since the last time. Then, I wrote this:
<br />
<br /><em>I know that this is how life goes. The change won't actually start on Friday night when we have another raucous farewell dinner, or in three weeks when we pack up and move out. 
<br />
<br />The change is happening right now as the sky darkens, and dusk comes a little earlier than it did tomorrow. 
<br />
<br />It'll start tomorrow which will be the last Monday that I'll say “Morning,’’ to her when she comes downstairs with the kittens miaowing round her feet and puts the coffee on. 
<br />
<br />It started a week ago when I told her we were going, and in a way it started ten months ago when we brought up the boxes of things from London and moved in, started this thing which would one day end.</em>
<br />
<br />(My internal monologue tends to the melodramatic.)
<br />
<br />I didn't imagine that I'd be coming back. I like to think of my life as a linear trajectory, a progression. Further and higher, faster and stronger. In reality, life sometimes comes in waves. Sometimes circles back, or stays in the same place, drilling.
<br />
<br />Maybe a spiral would be more accurate than a circle, if we're thinking in shapes. Because returning to the same geographic point - the same room, even, with a view on to the garden, and the thud of the catflap punctuating the night - is a neat way of showing what else has changed. 
<br />
<br />I'm repeating myself living in Cambridge again. Laying down another layer, a slightly different one, over the top of what went before. It's a comfort, actually, to remind myself of that. It's OK. It's Autumn. The light doesn't come through til after seven and I forgot what it's like to have wet feet, and the leaves that are green, turn to brown.
<br />
<br />And I realize more and more that those times when I am anxious and sad are just a point on the carousel. A part of the spiral, a feature of my orbit, that I return to once in a while. Doing things differently, taking risks, feels like it could make things worse. In fact, it expands that circle. Makes it bigger, so I return less frequently to that spot. 
<br />
<br />And taking risks sometimes means doing what you need to do even if it bruises your ego, or looks like going backwards. In the bigger picture, we're all moving forwards, because what else is there to do? Where else is there to go?
<br />
<br />Self-sufficiency means I know I can deal with what comes, and that my happiness is rooted inside me. Will come with me, wherever I go. 
<br />
<br />Have you ever returned somewhere you didn't think you would? What did it feel like? Let me know.
