    <h3>Madeleine Forbes</h3>

        <p>In 2011, I quit my job, left my home, and took a ferry to Santander on the north coast of Spain.</p>

        <p>Everything I thought I would need for the next six months in four panniers clipped to my bicycle, the same one I used to ride to work on in London. Eight panniers, if you include the one's on Nick's bike, because he was there too.</p> 

        <p>From there I travelled - mainly by bike, a couple of trains - to Algeciras on the south coast of Spain.</p>

        <p>Then, another ferry to Tangiers. Then, all the way to Marrakesh. No trains this time. </p>

        <p>I'm telling you this not because it's especially interesting or impressive. Interesting things happened to me along the way, of course, but now's not the time for those stories. Not yet. </p>

        <p>I'm telling you this because that was the point when I decided to start actually living my life by doing the exciting and interesting and frightening things I'd always wanted to. Like writing, and making other peoples' writing better. Getting paid for the work I love and am good at. Instead of waiting for some rose tinted future where my dreams would come true on their own, somehow, if I just put in enough hours at the office.</p>

        <p><strong>(I promise you I'm not trying to sell you any personal development bullshit.)</strong></p>

        <p>You know what they say, one thing leads to another. Tends to be true. Somehow, getting on my bicycle and cycling thousands and thousands of kilometres, led me to this website.</p>

        <p>The blog I started on that trip was on Blogger. 2012 I moved it to Wordpress. 2013, I read <a href="http://git.gwenbell.com/">Git Commit</a>, and started thinking a little harder about the machine I'm writing this on and how it connects to the machine you're reading this on (via a Virtual Private Server in New York, as it happens).</p>

        <p>I stopped bullshitting. I learned how to use git. It was hard, and it was worth it. I <a href="code.html">built this site</a> and connected with people and got some clarity. I also got saddled with an unscratchable itch to learn more code, but that's another story.</p>

        <p>So this isn't a sales pitch or an apology. It's how I got here. I'm half way through the first draft of my second novel. And I want to finish it, and more importantly I want to find the work I love, using these skills I've practised since I made that choice. The web for me is no longer status updates and cheesy oneliners. It's a craft.</p>

        <p>There is an archive of writing I published over the last couple months on the left. I'm having a brief break at the moment, because there are only so many hours in the day.</p>

        <p>If you want to chat, or if you think we could work together, I'm at madeleine@madeleineforbes.co.uk.</p>

        <p>I'm on twitter as well, backwards and sporadically, @ForbesMadeleine</p>

        <p>See you in September. Or maybe sooner.</p>

        <br>

<p> <strong>Fuel</p></strong>

<p> I know as little as anyone does about the world, seeing only through these two eyes. I read as much as I can. The knowledge I absorb is <a href="notes.html">fuel</a></li> for my writing, and for learning how to live. I gather it online, because it's good to keep kindling close to you. By the time you need to light the fire it can be too late. That's another story I'm not going to tell you. Yet.</p>
