        <p> <strong>Friday 24 May 2013</p></strong>
        <p>It's been a while.</p>
        <hr>
         
<p> <strong>Horses</p></strong>
         <p>I wanted a horse so much when I was a child. My Dad’s aunt had two or three elderly ponies in a ramshackle old stable on the top of a hill, and I loved them. I loved the smell of the saddles and the bridles, working soft polish into the worn leather. I loved scooping up the feed out of the big metal bin. I loved brushing them and cleaning their hooves and leading them by a halter into the field.</p>
<p>My favourite horse books were My Friend Flicka and Jinny and these were books about girls who grew up and found freedom with their horses, and learned to be strong and independent instead of worrying about school and what they looked like and all the other things that sucked at my feet like a tide, aged ten or eleven, restless and filled with a kind of unexplainable rage.</p>
<p>We lived in the city and we couldn’t afford a horse. Instead I went to the Horse Rangers Association, which was a bit like girl guides on horseback. One of those strange archaic youth groups featuring a dusty hall where we young people stood in lines and were bossed about by people barely older than us, who got to wear different clothes and who introduced us to things like discipline and shouting, and later held parties where we learned about drinking and boys and gossip the following day.</p>
<p> Do these organisations still exist? Alongside Pinterest and Instagram and Facebook, do kids still pay to get shouted at in halls? Looking back I can’t see a reason for any of that pomp, and yet I feel instinctively that it did me good in some way, perhaps a distorted echo of an experience that had formed characters decades before, only the lining up was for real then, and the shouting was serious, and the aim was war.</p>
<p>My Saturdays started at half eight and I was always late. The kids who got there early would get to tack up the horses, brush them and feed them and put on their equipment. Later, older, I managed it sometimes in the brief window of self discipline before I started going to raves all night, and Saturday mornings ceased to exist in quite the same way. But usually I was late. I would stop and stroke the horse whose stable was nearest to the steps that led to the hall, a big old white gelding called Sandal. </p>
<p>Upstairs I would wait in line and be allocated a horse to ride. The horses were categorised by how much they could bear on their backs, and so my introduction to tracking my weight - a pillar of adolescent self-loathing and control freakery, if you’re female, was not to look thin, but to ride my favourite pony, a bay mare called Raucheen. Eight and a half stone. I remember when I started I could say “seven stone”, and felt sorry for the older girls, the fifteen year olds lumpy in their jodhpurs and stuck with the slowly heavy cobs. I liked the speedy arab ponies. I did not want to get lumpy and old, hah, so little did I know. </p>
<p>The first lot of riders would leave on horseback, after much girth tightening and banter. It was a privilege for the younger girls to lead the horse out of the stable like a squire and help the rider up. About half an hour later we would troop across to Bushy Park in green anoraks and cream jodphurs and wait on our own, supervised by the oldest ones who were, I don’t know, twelve? Fourteen? Not old. Sometimes it was freezing and my feet would feel like blocks of ice in the thin leather boots, crouched under a tree. When we were little we would play while we waited, pretend riding lessons and tag and I don’t know what. Finally the horses would arrive and the next lot of riders would get on, and this was repeated once or twice more, and then we all went home. </p>
<p>The actual riding was beautiful. Crisp early mornings in the Royal Park; cantering down ancient rides. Blue skies and green grass, herds of deer across the park. Stags bellowing in the autumn. Trotting together, as one, as a ride, not an individual rider. A connection to something older and deeper. Actually, it was a lot like cycling has become for me - a chance to be companionable while remaining in my own thoughts. I think I still had the same tendency to turn my face towards the sun and smile, and get lost in my head. And that was how I learned to ride, to hold back an excitable horse, to let the reins out long so a tired one could drop its head and stretch on the walk back. </p>
<p>I’m conscious, now, of how twee and British and impossibly middle class it sounds. It was, and it wasn’t. We only got to ride every other week. On the alternate Saturdays we learned “stable skills”, which meant we mucked out the stables. I remember it being so cold we couldn’t throw water on the cobbles or it would freeze. Finding a little drowned mouse stiff and soaking in big water bucket. Lying down on the ground with an arm down one of the old drains, scooping out rotten crap that was blocking it. Working, hard, shifting tons of wet straw and wood shavings, stacking the muck heap into neat steps, shouting and joking and sweeping down the yard afterwards.</p>
<p>Some people say girls like riding horses because it gives them a sexual thrill, and I can see that - something about being hot and sweaty and out of control with a big strong beast between your legs. But actually, I think it’s more than that. Riding horses is about power, and little girls don’t have much power, in real life. It requires patience, and strength, and sometimes brute force. A girl can smack a horse if it’s naughty and it’ll barely feel it, but if she’s nervous or uncertain it will sense it and misbehave. </p>
<p>Ten year old girls in real life don’t get to smack people, don’t have any way to assert themselves, and so they decide to make themselves thin, or to get good grades, or to learn about using sex to control people. You can’t mess around with a horse; it takes strength, and courage, and at the same time patience. Judgement. Sometimes they get out of control, and you learn to deal with that, to protect yourself, to know when to duck quickly out of the stable before they spin and lunge and strike out with those metal clad hooves. When you land smack on the ground after a big ex-racehorse has galloped off with you and thrown you off, and you watch it receding into the distance, breathless and battered. You have to pick yourslef up and go catch the damn thing. Get back on it.</p>
<p>I learned to work. To manage people. I wielded a pitchfork until I had blisters on my hands, I got covered in shit and mud and straw, and I was cold and tired, and I kept going. These skills have proved more valuable to me than I knew they would be. I still see my best friend at the time, and other than that, I know nothing of what happened to the other kids. One by one we grew up and left. I met one of the girls a long time later, at a party in Brighton when she told me about her struggles with depression, and that Ketamine was the only thing she’d found that helped. Funny, that our paths should have collided in such different spheres. It’s hard being a woman whatever way you look at it and actually it’s hard being a human being. Sometimes we learn enough from an experience that we have the tools to cope with later challenges, and sometimes the things you come up against are just too much, and that’s just the way it is. </p>
<p>I would still like to have a horse one day. I’m not too fussed about riding it. I’d like to have a pony to rest my head against and breath in that strong, sweet, tangy horse scent. To lead by its halter, long fat smooth rope slack in my hand, to measure feed in a scoop out of a bucket, to brush and pat and clean its hooves. They’re remarkable creatures, gentle and intelligent and kind. Beautiful.</p>
<p> But I no longer think I’d want to hit it or gallop fast or be thrown from it. It was my birthday last week and one thing I’ve noticed about getting older is those thrills I used to chase when I was younger no longer seem so attractive. I know I’ll have to deal with things that are terrifying and adrenalising and life threatening, soon enough, whether I want to or not. I don’t need to seek out those situations deliberately the way I used to. </p>
