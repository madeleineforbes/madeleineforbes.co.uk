        <p> <strong>Tuesday 7th May 2013</p></strong>
        <p>First day back after four whole days without going online, except to check directions. I did not write, I did not read a book. I must be on the right track, because today I am bursting to get back to work. New writing coming on coding, horses, and everything in between.</p>
        <hr>
         
<p> <strong>Wild Camping Part II</p></strong>
         <p>We stopped. It led up to a wood, and we got off and pushed the bikes up into it. It was quiet in the tall pines, needles springy under our feet. We walked around a bit trying to decide where to pitch the tent. I was nervous. It was farmland, not wild, and there were piles of rubbish, under the trees. Discarded beer cans and bottles, litter. It wasn’t like a magical glade where fairies would live. It was a scrubby little woodland on a farm on the edge of town. Eventually we found some discarded shotgun shells and that was enough, OK, Nick said, fine. We’ll go further in.</p> 

<p>We kept going towards the town. After we passed under the motorway, there was a big kind of roadside restaurant type place set back in a carpark, and behind it some more scrubby trees. Although the hill was steep, we pushed on up, where the road wound up and came out at the top by the little castle. From the top you could see for miles, all the way we just come across La Mancha, and the darkening sky. There was no one around. Eventually we found a bar and I asked if there was a pensione somewhere, a room. The bar man was sorry, he couldn’t help us. He filled up our water bottles and I started to feel a bit wobbly. </p>

<p>I went back out and told Nick and we went back down the hill. We looked at the land next to the roadhouse-motel type place, that bordered the overpass. Sleeping in the trees next to the roar of traffic wasn’t the wild camping I’d imagined. I kept thinking of these cycle touring blogs I’d read, and one quote stuck in my mind, a woman had written that somehow, however impossible it seemed, a place to stay always presented itself, just when they needed it. But this wasn’t it. I didn’t want to leave the town but I didn’t want to camp there either, and I felt cornered and worried.</p>

<p>Nick was fed up. We’d said we were going to wild camp as much as possible. Fine, he said, if you don’t want to stop, then we’ll keep going. If that’s what you want. </p>

<p>Back on the bikes, heavy as ever, we pushed off again, crawled back up the hill for the second time. Set off towards the next place on the map, across the plain. We’d cooled down; my legs were tired.  The sky purple as a bruise. As we were leaving we passed a farm where a huge brindle dog, square headed like a bull terrier lunged at us barking and slavering, until it choked itself quiet on the end of the chain. </p>

<p>The first few drops of rain started to fall, and I stopped my bike. I don’t remember exactly what I said, but it was along the lines of: this is madness. It’ll be dark soon. We can’t keep going, not like this, I’m tired. We have to go back. </p>

<p>We turned round and went back down the hill, away from the storm. We stopped before the roadside restaurant and pushed our bikes into the forest, the bags a dead weight, catching on trees. We went as far as we could, and we could hear the road a bit. These were pine trees too, and there were bits of litter, but it wasn’t like the woods belonged to anyone. This was wasteland, a forgotten corner. We could see the restaurant through the trees. We put the bikes down and got the tarp out and strung it up between two trees, to make a bivouac. As the first few drops of rain pattered on the plastic, we put the tent up and scrabbled for the stove. </p>

<p>So my first night free camping wasn’t on a beach or in a national park. It was in wet pinewoods at the back of a raodside restaurant. We had cigarettes, a carton of cheap wine, we had pasta and tomatoes and a nub of chorizo, and we cooked them all up in our square tins and laughed and listened to the rain drumming on the tent. We had a little wind up lamp that used to go out all the time, god knows why we kept it, we kept winding it up and talking and then going quiet and listening to the rain and the trees. </p>

<p>When we were cold we put on all our clothes, tights and leggings and jumpers and I wore my purple wooly hat that Nick’s mum had bought me for my birthday. There was barely warm to move in the worlds-most-lightweight-tent because the so-called sleeping bags we’d got were too thin and we were always cold. I slept fitfully, the wind and the rain rushing in the trees, imagining that a tree might fall on our tent or a drunk might stagger out from the bar and find us. I worried that the bikes weren’t safe and that someone might steal our things. <p>

<p>In the morning, trees dripping around us, everything seemed mundane. As things do, in the morning. The woods were quiet, the noise of the motorway had faded to a blur. We got dressed in our multiple layers and packed up the tent and I marvelled at how inconspicuous it looked. Loaded up the panniers and pushed the bikes down to the carpark and chained them up outside the restaurant.</p> 

<p>Then we went and joined the truckers and travellers and locals, and as far as I could see, no one knew. We had cafe con leche and a tosta mista and fried churros covered in sugar. We used the bathroom to wash our faces and hands and I grinned at myself in the mirror like I’d pulled off some kind of heist. We said gracias, and goodbye, and then we left the restaurant bellies full, and happy, and got back on the bikes. Up the hill, for a third time. And back onto the plain.
