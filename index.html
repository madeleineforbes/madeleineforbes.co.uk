        <p> <strong>Thursday 30 May 2013</p></strong>
        <p>Left over apricot pie for breakfast. Another morning with no sunrise, the sky a heavy, pressing grey. </p>
        <hr>

        <p> <strong>Writing and code</p></strong>
         
<p>I gave Hannah a draft to edit six months ago. She’s good. She’s been giving me razor sharp criticism on my writing for the last ten years now. Clichés don’t stand a chance.</p>

<p>Hannah says, “The trouble with writing is, you know what you mean.” </p>

<p>It’s good advice. The reader isn’t sure what you’re getting at when you say his smile was dusty or his shoulders went down in that way they do, y’know, when they’re kind of tired and… blah blah blah. It’s no good. How can you make them see what you mean? You have to be precise. Same with the machine. If you don’t tell it what colour your navbar should be, or what font you want the buttons in, it won’t know. </p>

<p>Somerset Maugham, whose opinion I respect almost as much as Hannah's, says</p>

<p>“Some writers who do not think clearly are inclined to suppose that their thoughts have a significance greater than at first sight appears. It is flattering to believe that they are too profound to be expressed so clearly that all who run may read, and very naturally it does not occur to such writers that the fault is with their own minds, which have not the faculty of precise reflection.”</p>

<p>So I know what I mean, but it’s a matter of pure ego for me to assume that if you don’t it’s because you’re stupid. If what I mean is expressed precisely, clearly, without padding or faff, then anyone can see what I'm trying to say. The way any computer can understand code, or any typesetter can understand the strange little shorthand symbols proof readers use.</p> 

<p>Another thing I used to say about myself is, “I don’t like maths”. Maths would have included code. But this is also laziness. This is assuming that writing is in some way better, more intuitive, less fixed, than maths is with its rules and equations. More arrogance. It’s not. You write the words and the reader makes the meaning. And yes, words can be tingly, and wonderful, and sexy, and funny. They can make you laugh or cry, or turn on all the lights and the TV late at night when you’re alone in the house, because the chill that just went down your spine was real.</p>

<p>But if you don’t have something clear to say, and if the reader doesn’t get that meaning, then it’s your fault for not being precise or clear enough - for trying to obfuscate the message with fanciness or padding or style. This should not be trusted. Saying “I don’t like maths” is saying “maths is hard”, and the reason it’s hard is because you can’t bullshit. But bullshit doesn’t make writing better. It makes it harder, because it’s easy to fall into. Good writing is like good maths - it’s clear, and transparent, and you can see how they did it, even if you could never have come up with it yourself. </p>

<p>It’s all in the details.</p>
