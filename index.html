      <br />Hi, I'm <a href="about.html">Madeleine Forbes</a>. Thanks for pausing here, now. 
<br />
<br />Today, 21 December 2013, I packed the car for a long drive to a small island off the west coast of Scotland. I'll be seeing in the new year with my love, in front of a wood fire, with nothing to do except dream and plot for the year to come. 
            <br />

<h4>What I Learned About Communism This Summer</h4>
<br />
When we arrived in Olztyn it was pouring. The gently rolling fields, some hay, some pasture, and the white farmhouses dotting the creases in between, were gradually obscured by a sheet of rain. We didn’t have a seat on the train and instead were wedged together in the footwell of a door to the baggage car. We sat in peaceable silence as the train rolled through the countryside and the night came to meet the storm, and all was dark and grey.
<br />
<br />Peter met us on the platform, grinning through this sheet of rain, and we hurried down into the subway and walked out to meet his father. 
<br />
<br />A very new car, and very clean. We walked into the ground floor of a tall concrete high-rise block. All of the high-rises were painted the same, and they had numbers and writing on the side. 
<br />
<br />We went up in the lift, an old fashioned one made of metal. As it moved upwards I watched the doors on each floor pass by slowly. There was just about room for four of us and our bags. It was a lift designed for people who were not fat. 
<br />
<br />We were welcomed by his mother, who gave us bowls of steaming hot, delicious soup, salty and savoury, with chunks of sausage and potatoes. Then homemade pierogi (dumplings) with sour cream. Do not imagine a large red peasant-y lady, which is what I associate with bowls of sausage soup. Magda has blonde hair, is very smiley and young looking, kind of glamorous. While we ate - there was only room for three of us in the little kitchen - she hovered by the door and smiled and sometimes Peter translated for us. 
<br />
<br />We talked about Communism. Because when he was a kid, the Berlin wall was still up. When I was a kid, too. I was on the other side. 
<br />
<br />There were food tokens. Magda showed them to us, she had kept some. There was an allocation of 500g of meat for each child, for a month. Which isn’t all that much. And there was another store - she showed us some paper covered in the brand, which I think featured a rabbit - an American store, where you could buy different things. Imported goods. They had friends and family in the West and they would send over dollars to spend at this store, which was a huge treat. And they laughed about it, we all did, because it seemed such a strange story. 
<br />
<br />Peter remembers queueing along empty shelves, waiting hours for bread. And he was talking about the very same space, probably the very same shelves, where we went to stock up on delicious smoked sausage and fresh radishes and Wasabi flavoured crisps and Coca cola. That was what struck me. 
<br />
<br />Within my lifetime, that space had been something else entirely. The kind of place I learned about in history books, in a place where you didn’t work for money, and you didn’t have the freedom to buy your own stuff. 
<br />
<br />Everyone got the same, but some people got better. The apartment was a good one. Windows on both sides. Next door, they said, was smaller, and there were only windows on one side. It would get really hot in the summer, no through breeze. And there was no choice over that. Each family was allocated a space and that was all they had, and tough shit if you got the one with no windows. People were hungry and there was not enough food. And Peter’s father told us, the worst thing was how people accepted it. There was so little resistance, so little perception that there could be another way. 
<br />
<br />We watched a movie while were were there. A black comedy. About a guy who teaches in a university and he lives in a little apartment which seemed strangely familiar. Because it was the same kind of apartment we were in. And when he took the lift down to go to work it was the same lift we had been in. 
<br />
<br />It’s very hard to imagine a culture where everyone comes from the same apartment, every day. And the movie goes on and he gets the bus to work and he is very depressed, in a hilarious way, and spends a lot of time contemplating what life means and why he is here. 
<br />
<br />And watching I thought, this is psychological torture, everyone having the same. No choice in what you do or how you live. There is no hunger there to do better, to express yourself. You are not motivated by the ability to choose the life you want to lead. And so I guess these dark, surreal artists develop, who are not deluded by the illusion that they have any control over their circumstances. They point out life for the absurdity it is, deeply funny and deeply sad.
<br />
<br />The thing I learned about Communism this summer was that it was hard. And painful. And as a mother, you did not know how you would feed your kids sometimes.
<br />
<br />But Peter didn’t have a hard childhood, that’s the thing. He had the best childhood. He played outside with the other kids, because the high-rises weren’t where the poor, the broken, the troubled lived. People didn’t move away, when they made more money. They were where everyone lived. And the family didn’t have a lot of space, and they’re close. Really close. And the photos and the stories and the love I felt in that room were testament to that
<br />
<br />Our governments tell us that the markets will save us, and yet don't they seem fragile? These structures which we’re told will make us prosperous seem to need an awful lot of sacrifice to keep going. Our Gods promise prosperity, comfort, leisure, but first we must pay them a lot of money, must sell our time and use the proceeds to prop them up, and they tell us that’s normal, they say, don’t question it. You wouldn’t understand. 
<br />
<br />And like a lot of people I think “Is this it? Is this as good as it gets? Isn’t there an alternative?”
<br />
<br />This summer I learned that Communism didn’t work either. None of it works at the end of the day, these central systems for organising and accumulating and rationing out the money and the things and the houses. They pretend to be objective, a kind of science, but a system like that can’t ever take into account the unique, the individual.
<br />
<br />The things we own aren’t going to save us. What might save us is our connection to one another. Our shared humanity, our shared vulnerability, our fears and hopes and our individual talents, and our forging of authentic connections. I think it’s dangerous to stop thinking and it’s harmful to feel that you’re helpless, that your uniqueness means nothing, that you’re part of a system that’s bigger than you and you can’t comprehend. Life isn’t about scrabbling for an ever-decreasing pot of resources. It’s about bringing what you have, with honesty, working hard and using the talents you’ve been given. 
<br />
<br />As this year ends, I raise a glass, and it might as well be vodka. To the unique, the individual, the community. To loving our differences and acknowledging our fundamental similarities. To the future.
