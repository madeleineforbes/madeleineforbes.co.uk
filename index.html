    <p>
I've been getting interested in systems.  Take chakras. There are seven, just like the seven days in the week, notes in a scale, colours in a spectrum.</p>

<p>It’s possible to interpret these points on a purely physical level, as sites corresponding to nerve centres within the body. Genitals, gut, stomach, heart, throat, eyes and ears, mind.</p>  

<p>But chakras are also metaphysical. I read somewhere they're:</p>  

  <blockquote>‘Seven wheel-like energy centres… Swirling intersections of vital life forces, each chakra    reflects an aspect of consciousness essential to our lives.’</blockquote> 

<p>I don't know about energy flows and swirling intersections. Luckily, I’m not interested in the facts. I'm interested in the story. The progression from the roots of the first chakras to the free floating power of the connected mind.</p>  

<p>The story of why I need to be rooted in safety and stillness, fed and comforted, before I can begin to dream and manifest impossible things. Why it’s impossible to love another person, truly, before you love yourself. Why your business needs a cause you believe in and expertise you would defend with your fists, before you can start fancifying your images, finding your voice.</p>

<p>Chakras are a scaffold for thinking systematically about our emotional and physical wholeness. They call to memory the time I helped someone I love sweep up the charred remains of all of her most precious belongings, birthday cards and journals and jewellery. Burned. Gone. But I couldn’t cry, until a particularly intense yoga class weeks later left me sweating and snivelling on the mat as the class packed away and the Bikram group hovered at the door.</p>  

<p>You see, this stuff doesn't need to involve magic. It explains things. It's a system</p>  

<hr>

<p>Ashtanga yoga. Another system. A repeated series of poses, building in difficulty, to be repeated daily,  devotedly. There are three series, of which the last is frankly superhuman, and I am a poor and sporadic student of the first.</p>

<p>I'm too flexible, is the thing. I slide into the poses, but without the core strength a sag seeps into the asana, wearing away at my joints. Knee twinges that I don’t want to tell people about. I'm getting old.</p>

<p>It's something of a metaphor for life actually.  Because I've always been very good at being flexible and charming and accommodating.</p> 

<p>Working in Local Government I prided myself on helping people, on wriggling through the bureaucratic minefield and actually solving problems, sorting them out.</p>

<p>For years I explained funding decisions to parents grieving for a childhood without psychologists and occupational therapists and life skills. Through tears and battles and quiet, imperceptible victories I learned never to say no, always to explain, to tease out the nuances and the exceptions from the tangled mass of policy and budgets.</p>  

<p>What fascinated me was the point at which the perfect system - the fair allocation of public resources to those in need - crashed like a wave on the jagged, unpredictable, unfair realities of life.</p>  

<p>How can we assess a child’s intelligence when the only tools we have are ones we’ve made, stained with prejudice and ignorance and irrelevant measures of political goals? How can we look at an individual and divorce them somehow from their context, their home, the lush Fulham mansion and full time nanny, the one bedroom flat for five children, twice refugees, on their third language?</p>  

<p>The system cracks and breaks under the mess and chaos of humanity. I loved the frontline, and it exhausted me. I couldn’t bring myself to go deeper into management, further away from the practice and into policy, where offices are comfortable and paychecks are fat and you never actually have to get yelled at by the person who didn’t fit the criteria, who found themselves on the wrong side of the line. I liked staying flexible, but in the end, it was my weakness. An old one.</p> 

<p>Somewhere in between learning to talk and persuade and cajole, convincing people of our point of view, upholding the principles I loved of transparency and humanity, I missed the part where I said NO. I was the oldest child, you see, and I hadn't learned to. I negotiated. I squeezed past. I never stood hands on hips, square on. Didn’t develop that core strength.</p>  

<hr>

<p>Each time I practice the primary series I start with a concept in my mind. A perfect system. Of following the breath, deep warrior lungfuls, of flowing in and out like the ocean.</p>

<p>And each time I fall short. There is a ragged breath, or there is a pause. I slip and stagger out of a balance. I bend too deeply, or not far enough. I realise I've played it safe and not fully extended. The system is an ideal and I am human, broken, maybe I am tired or sick or worried or puffed up with the pride of my yoga-ness.</p>  

<p>What drives me on, and what hurts me is the gap between the flawless system in my head, in which everything is balanced and perfect, and the reality. That's where I am most vulnerable. In the falling down, in the trying.</p>  

<p>Maybe that's why I was drawn to work in Special Educational Needs in the first place. For children with additional needs, learning is more difficult, and in our current school system that means that a lot of their time is spent failing. The very best schools and teachers taught those children that the failures didn't matter. To look for the successes instead. One Headteacher of a school for kids with Autism told me "We spend most of our time making the children feel safe, because for most of them the problem is that they're too anxious to learn."</p>  

<p>And this is where the circle meets, the system closes, because when you are a perfectionist, even if you are a high achiever, then you are always failing too. And it's not fair on those who could never dream of achieving what you do, it's not fair on them that you feel like you've failed because you didn't measure up to some perfect system in your head. But it's true.</p> 

<hr>

<p>In my new work I'm starting to see a vision of something beautiful and strong, and that I want to be a part of. Together we start sketching out systems, workflows. Checklists. We write them as questions: Have you done this? Have you done the next thing?</p> 

<p>I think about my other systems. <em>Have you taken a deep breath in? Are you pressing your weight into both sides of the foot? Are your eyes trained on your palms?</em></p> 

<p><em>Have you drunk water and charged your laptop? Have you said good morning to your husband? Have you brushed your teeth?</em></p> 

<p><em>Have you called your parents? Have you written thank you letters for the gifts you have received? Have you paid your bills and rent and is your house clean and tidy?</em></p> 

<hr>

<p>As we walked from King's Cross we talked about work, and the parts that don't feel like work. The meeting and hugging and connecting. The bubbling of ideas, the words on the screen.</p> 

<p>What about the tech stuff, she said. How does that feel?</p>

<p>St Pancras station loomed in redbrick to our left. My heels made a noise on the dry pavement; we headed for the red buses.</p>

<p>It feels like a practice, I said. It's not play. It's not free, and what I meant was, it’s a system. You don't think "What asana shall I do next?" There is no choice. Coding you don't think "What key should I press next?" because what comes next is what needs to.</p>

<p>I try and I fail and fail and fail and that's the point where I am most tender. That's my edge. I sniff it and roam around it and try to get to know it, the way a horse does when something unfamiliar is in the field. I am wary, I look sideways. I might not be a fighter but I will defend myself with walls. You will not reach me.</p> 

<hr>

<p>There is a lightness to this systems thing, though parts are dark. The lightness is the play and the exploration and the freedom within the structure. When you're not wondering what asana to do next you can concentrate on the breath and the holding and the extension. Within the code we can focus on the content, the juicy, messy content. Within our business systems are our hopes and dreams and the things we believe in, the way we think our energy should be spent, and the knowledge that we serve other people, humans like ourselves, not robots.</p>  

<p>There are such things as trying and being kind and forgiving. Kindness is what takes me from the soft, teary space of being hurt and falling down, and strokes and reassures me that it's OK because I tried.</p> 

<p>We outgrow systems and they adapt. Laws are changed; belief systems evolve because we they no longer fit what we have learned. Some systems like Ashtanga stick around because they have been proven over thousands of years to be balanced just right, and even then we re-write them, veer off course, add in extra bits because we can.</p> 

<p>The systems are ours. They’re “shoulds”. And what we should do is different, not better, than what we could. Returning to what we can do, now, in this moment, draws our systems back down through the chakras, and into the earth.</p>

<p>I tell myself, your systems were never real in the first place. Not the way the mistakes are. They actually happened. We made them. That's what makes them beautiful.</p>
