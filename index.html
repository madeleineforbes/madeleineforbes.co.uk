        <p> <strong>Friday 31 May 2013</p></strong>
        <p>Almost half way through the year. A big to do list, but I am crossing things off it. Starting with a walk, including a detour through the churchyard to marvel at the twisted trunk of a yew tree I've not noticed before. The sun has come out.</p>
        <hr>

        <p> <strong>How I stopped worrying and learned to love the code</p></strong>

        <p>
          In the UK, git means a cantankerous old man. The US equivalent might be someone you would describe as "ornery". At first, that name was apt. Git and I did not get along.</p> 

<p>I started reading <a href="http://www.gwenbell.com"> Gwen Bell's</a> articles back in the beginning of the year. I watched her website go from a blank page, to snippets of writing, pages. Pages which slowly cohesed, dissipated, rearranged themselves, reshaped themselves into different things. </p>

<p>Wouldn't it be wonderful to watch the process sped up, like time-lapse photography? To watch a site unfurling, growing, changing, the way a bud unfurls? Labour can be painful; the outcome might not be what you expect.</p>

<i><p>The almond tree<br>
was beautiful in labour. Blood-<br>
dark, quickening, bud after bud<br>
split, flower after flower shook free.<br>
<br>
On the darkening wind a pale<br>
face floated. Out of reach. Only when<br>
the buds, all the buds were broken<br>
would the tree be in full sail.<br>
<br>
In labour the tree was becoming<br>
itself. I, too, rooted in earth<br>
<br>
and ringed by darkness, from the death<br>
of myself saw myself blossoming,</i><br>
<br>
(Read the whole poem by John Stallworthy<a href="//puisipoesy.blogspot.co.uk/2006/03/almond-tree.html"> here</a>, to wander down a whole other avenue of birth and meaning and the value of life) </p>


<p>One phrase stuck in my mind, spoke to me, and that was "Digital self-sufficiency". It's tied to the idea of becoming an "acive citizen of the web", that is creating the web we want, building it with our hands. The way the first people, the explorers, the pioneers did.</p> 

<p>Before then code seemed to be something slick, noisy, dark. Like a tall windowed skyscraper, thousands of floors, with black windows. And I do not want to live in the tall loud city, made of steel and concrete. I want to live out in the wild, to dig and root in the soil and to grow things from rain and sunlight.</p> 

<p>Digital self-sufficiency. All of a sudden, I saw the code as something else. As thousands of tiny roots and branches, extending out beneath the soil. As fur or feathers or blood vessels, creating something beautiful. Code isn't slick skyscrapers or copper wires, or at least it's not just that. Code is our dna, is Fibonnaci, the interleaving of scales on a fish, rainbows and tidea, an old stone sundial in a garden. </p>

<p>I can't quite explain the switch. I'd read about building websites before, and I'd even done a little HTML, but it hadn't sunk in. Now I see the web not as an impenetrable, cold, plastic mass, but as a living, breathing ecosystem that I can be a part of. No longer a passive consumer, scrolling through blogs, clicking from tab to tab, looking for something I couldn't have described. Now, the web is like a problem for me to solve in my own way, for my own purpose. I love problem solving.
