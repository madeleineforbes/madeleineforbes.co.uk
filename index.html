<p> <strong>Fuel</strong>

<p> I read as much as I can. It's <a href="notes.html">fuel</a></li> for my writing. I gather fragments online: I've learned to keep kindling close to you. By the time you need to light the fire it might be too late.</p>

        <p><h3>Rave</h3> </p>
      <p>
The year after I turned sixteen, I started hungering for something more than cheap sugary drinks in plastic cups, high heels and short dresses. Something beyond the sneers of gangs of schoolboys, girls judged and selected in the cattle market of crappy bars. </p>

<p>In those strange, hormone soaked years, my friends and I craved edges, boundaries, lines to cross. Hung out in abandoned parks and forgotten alleyways, seeking the fringes of the city, liminal spaces where the rules melted away.</p> 

<p>I was born in the eighties, and by that point the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_and_Public_Order_Act_1994" target="_blank">Criminal Justice and Public Order Act</a> of ’94 had been and gone. Older cousins, turning up dreadlocked and Doc Marten’d at family Christmases, bore with them whispers of this alternative world, but like all good things it came to an end and that end was before my time.</p>  

 <p>The generation who experienced the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_party" target="_blank">original wild parties</a> in the English countryside might dispute that paying money to get into a warehouse constitutes a true rave. But traces of those early field gatherings remained. The <a href="http://oniscoid.tumblr.com/page/2" target="_blank">psychedlic rainbow flyers</a>. The names: Pendragon, Raindance, Kundalini. Meeting other groups of aliens and misfits at the tube station, knowing they were heading to the same place, drawn like we were to the scent of something different.</p>  

<p>Bouncers who smiled and nodded when you approached, and waved you in. Cans of Red Stripe in the fridges behind the bar, and not much else. Staff standing bored or dancing - no one buys drinks at raves. Six foot tall ladies in platform boots with fur up to the knee, stretchy neon crop tops, dreads and shaved heads. Tie dye and <a href="http://cyberdognet.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">cybercore</a>, glowsticks and stalls selling weird shit, gummy fluoro tongue studs, bracelets and lighters. Smiles. These were the signs that we were in a different psycho-geographical space, a tear in the fabric, a temporary tent of reality imagined differently, a shared hallucination in which communities sprang up and my party was your party was all of us, here, now.</p> 

<p>So. New Year’s Eve, a year on from the millennium. Dark rainy streets. Precious, paper tickets, butterflies in stomach. A filthy, industrial exterior. And inside… women dressed as faeries made out with guys dressed as cyber-elves. Robots on stilts shooting light from their eyes waded through the crowd of dreadlocked cyber punks, to twisting, pulsing, industrial psychedelic trance. Lasers and visuals swelled and bloomed across vast bare walls. The venue was an old factory in pre-hipster Dalston, Tyssen Street studios, infamous for its twisting geography, vanishing rooms and indescribable toilets. Now the building is overpriced, luxury apartments. Then, it was like stepping into a vision, an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcxmYqpVHy0" target="_blank">alternate realm.</a></p>  

<p>We were in the basement. Lit by UV, oversized flowers and vines twisted and arced round the disused ventilation system. Pipes wreathed with tendrils. I remember only flashes of the night; a man with a set of playing cards with pictures of smiling haloed babies on them, like cherubs, picked out in glowing ink. Transfixing me. The music, those intoxicating rhythms, pounding and pounding into my bloodstream, into my heart. Some of the moments I remember are too holy to share. They existed in that night alone, connections with strangers, rushes and waves, presence like nothing I’d experienced. That was the beginning.</p> 

<p>I found home, at Tyssen Street and Bagleys and Fabric and The End, the Stratford Rex, the Drome, the Fridge and all the other places whose names changed and shifted, but whose crowd remained the same. The trepidation and the waiting, the stashing and the doling out, guys with hoodies in dark alleyways, bouncers like brick walls and the tiny kisok where they took the money and gave you a stamp, sometimes UV, sometimes something magical, a frog or a leaf or a mystical symbol.</p> 

<p>On the dancefloor, differences and divides melted away. Bottles of water shared and passed around. If you needed gum, you asked the guy next to you, and you’d get it with a smile, or a sorry face, palms open and down, head shaking, can’t help, still dancing. Hugs from strangers.</p>  

<p>After the psy-trance came drum and bass, and there was less tie-dye and more trainers and tracksuits, baseball caps. I’d wear a miniskirt, a bikini top, comfy shoes. That moment when the music’s rolling and you’ve found your rhythm. Sweating and smiling on the dancefloor, and your friends are around you, doing the moves they always do at this time in the night. A <a href="http://freshwaterwhales.tumblr.com/post/48741428396/joy-by-zadie-smith" target="_blank"> better writer than me</a> described it.</p> 

<p>“Everything I tried to look at quickly shattered and arranged itself in a series of patterned fragments, as if I were living in a kaleidoscope. Where was I trying to get to anyway? There was no longer any “bar” or “chill-out zone”—there was only dance floor. All was dance floor. Everybody danced.” Zadie Smith</p> 

<p>In the best moments, a holy trinity of DJ, MC and crowd was created and sustained. The MC narrating, building up, telling us how we felt, how he felt, what was happening. Spitting a rhyme, a tale, both performance and commentary on that performance, meta, shifting. It could be funny, or scary, or compelling, urging you on. An amphetamine bard, deep voices dancing over the bass, keeping us going, talking us through it, building it up, one two one two, don’t stop, yeah, yes yes, a stream of poetry, unbroken, flowing like water. Building and building, inevitably, the beats getting faster, the horns coming in, building still, until that moment of glorious silence.</p> 

<p>A millisecond. A breath. The bit in the horror film before they pull the mask off the murderer. Ten pages from the end of the book, that moment when you’re almost shaking with excitement because this is it, the resolution, the reveal. The point in a movie where they look at each other in the rain, right before they kiss. </p> 

<p>And then it’s there. The beat drops, and the MC’s voice is suddenly quiet, and you look at the person next to you and grin like a maniac and they grin right back at you, and the whole club is moving as one, going nuts. It’s summitting the rollercoaster, orgasm, relief, feet moving faster than ever, the music inside you, no longer dancing, just molecules possessed by those rolling jungle breakbeats, letting it flow. I hugged so many people, talked to people from all over, never did they judge me, only love, only love.</p>  

<p>“On that dance floor I was joy, or some small piece of joy, with all these other hundreds of people who were also a part of joy.” Zadie Smith</p> 

<p>I have a name for it now, <a href="http://gwenbell.com/writing" target="_blank"></a>compersion. That was what we felt. Seeing someone really into it, going over to tap them on the shoulder. Big twitchy pupils, always the blank look of amazement, and then the hug, and the laughing, and back to the dance. It was a way of telling them, I love how happy you are, I love how you’re moving, love that we’re both human here, in this moment, this miracle. That smell, pressed against a stranger’s shoulder - sweat and chemicals and sweat and cigarettes and marijuana and sweat. I wouldn’t recognise my own face in the bathroom mirror. I’d drift through crowds of thousands and always we’d find each other, always we’d come back to our friends.</p>  

<p>I can’t explain how I feel when I read that piece. I was transported back. Zadie, I wanted to say, if you were freaking out at Fabric there were always places to chat. You should have come out to the stairs. Those infamous columns of spiralling chaos, they brought an older spirit to that industrial club, fifteen pounds to get in are you kidding, no wonder everyone’s drinking water. The stairs was where the hookups and the back massages, the hugs and the heart to hearts took place.</p>  

<p>When inside Goldie or Brockie or Andy C tore it up. You entered from the back of the main room, pushed through the crowd, and by the time you were at the far stage, there was no going back, and who would want to. Lasers like an ocean above the heads of the crowd, that sound system, those warm plastic bottles of water.</p>  

<p>Catching the tube back across London on Saturday mornings, people on their way to work. Waterloo, big and empty, before there were barriers. We never had tickets. We’d smoke on the trains. Walk back through empty suburban streets, on bright summer mornings, or dark frosty ones. Pile into someone’s parents house, line up like sardines on the floor in duvets and tracksuits, drink tea after tea after tea and comfort ourselves, nurture ourselves back to reality, a microcosm of the wider collective from the night before.</p>  

<p>Two days later, I’d be on time for college again, and I’d have the best stories to tell. Being young, we’d do it all again the following week. This was where I first learned to be loving even to those I did not know, and where I learned to receive love like I deserved it, whoever I was. Where I learned to let go.</p>
