        <p> <strong>Tuesday 28 May 2013</p></strong>
        <p>Old friends, ale, rain. Feels like a day for making memories of my home here. Also, apologies to any US readers for using "maths" in the post below. I know you say "math". I'm sure you can find a way to deal.</p>
        <hr>

        <p> <strong>Details</p></strong>
         
<p>So I just did this proof-reading course. The old fashioned way. Editing for the supremely anal. Proofing isn’t about the sense or the style. It’s “Is that comma in the right font? Are those quote marks in italics? Did you leave two spaces instead of one?”</p>

<p>For a long time, “pays attention to detail” was something I said about myself in job interviews and on application forms. It wasn’t true. What I meant was, I’m a good writer and I’m good at spelling. Which is not the same.</p> 

<p>I found this out because I sucked at the course, and that really threw me. I couldn’t believe how bad I was. But I went to Oxford! I can spell conscientious! I’m a genius! The green pen of my tutor didn’t lie, though. I was terrible.</p> 

<p>I tried really hard. I took my time. I started reading things backwards, one word at a time, to stop my brain distracting me with the story. There is a story in anything, even a textbook, even a technical manual. I read things three, four, five times. I made a checklist. I was methodical. Each time, I spotted more of the things, the commas, the italics, the spacing. I became a little bit obsessed. I’d long since realized that proof reading is a dying art in the age of the web. Or at least, being a freelance proofreader is. Maybe pull requests will give me a new lease of life as a grammatical web warrior of pedantry… maybe not. But I was going to pass if it killed me.</p> 

<p>On the Friday before my birthday, as I was leaving to buy burrito ingredients for the 8 hour car journey, I saw the letter on the doorstep. I did it. I scraped through, probably the worst pass mark I’ve ever got, but a pass. </p>

<p>I’d learned to pay attention to detail. I learned to see what is there, and not what I think is there. At least some of the time. This is a Zen thing - beginner’s mind - and it’s a code thing. Downloading git, I could not get the damn thing to work. I’d made a typing error. One character wrong is all it takes. You have to see what’s there. You have to pay attention. To the detail. </p>

<p>I’m still not there, with the code, with the proofing. I’m trying. I’m learning. I’m failing, and failing again, and failing better - just like the cliche. Clichés are OK for proof readers though, as long as they’re spaced and punctuated correctly. It’s copy editors who don’t like clichés.</p>
