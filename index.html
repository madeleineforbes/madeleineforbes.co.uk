    <p><h4>
      <br />Hi, I'm <a href="about.html">Madeleine</a>. Thanks for pausing here, now. </h4>
          <br />I'm a writer. I write to a small list of readers, across the world. You can join us by signing up on the left or <a href="archive13.html">read the archive here</a>. 
      <br />
      <br />When I'm not writing, I help online businesses connect with their clients and develop human-friendly systems, to make work feel peaceful.
      <br />
      <br />I'm also a proofreader. I can help you make your book, site or e-course the very best it can be. 
       <br />
       <br />If you're interested in working together you can <a href="mailto:madeleine@madeleineforbes.co.uk">email me here</a>. 
       <br />
        <br />When I'm not doing any of those things I like to cook, read and bicycle. Current tea obsession: Vanilla Rooibos. Delicious.

<br /><strong>5th February 2014</strong>
<br />Nine more days of this life to go, this life where I wake up most days and cycle to a room in a large building where I have to stay for the next six hours, wearing things I don't always feel like wearing and talking to people I don't always feel like talking to.
<br />
<br />It's been almost a decade since I graduated from University and entered the big bad world and accepted this wisdom from everyone I knew: that work was supposed to be hard, and tiring, and boring. And a rule I came up with all by myself: that I couldn't just do what I wanted, do what I was interested in. That wasn't enough.  
<br />
<br />It turns out, that's all a load of bullshit. There are no rules and you can do whatever you want, if you're prepared to work hard. And actually, the hardest part was remembering what I actually like to do in the first place. 
<br />
<br />I couldn't be happier to be making this change and one of the treats I'm anticipating is spending more time in this digital space, making it just the way I want it. I'm looking forward to diving into CSS, to taking more photographs, to going on walks and savouring each day and cooking exactly what I want for lunch. 
<br />
<br />And I've started my next piece, too, which will be about my digital life. I can't wait to hear about everyone else's too. If you want to join us, pop your name in the sidebar on the left.

<br /><strong>19th January 2014</strong>
<br> I'm waking up in a strange bed at my sister's house in London. There are moustaches printed on the sheets and a clothes dryer in the room. Charlotte gave me an extra blanket in case I was cold but I slept like a baby and woke up toasty warm with the January sun seeping through the gap round the blind. 
<br />
<br />I dreamed that someone stabbed me last night and I didn't care. I closed my eyes and knew what would happen and the dream moved on with me, dead. 
<br />
<br />New opportunities are appearing and I'm feeling brave and happy and scared. I don't like change and I don't like "letting people down". Which means I work hard at building relationships. I like to feel needed and relied on. I then feel like I can't change the status quo, can't leave, because they'll miss me. It's a perfect catch 22.  
<br />
<br />Only 20 days in, this year has been a process of metamorphosis, of regeneration. I feel as though I'm emerging from a chrysalis, sleek and shiny. 
<br />
<br />Today I'm going to see my husband's new tattoo, only 24 hours old, for the first time. See my parents and my other siblings. Send an email that will catalyse the changes that are approaching. Take deep breaths and feel brave. Remind myself, this is what I want. 
<br />
<br />What's next?
<hr />
<strong>11th January 2014</strong>
<br> I had a writing date. I met Ava at the station and we went to pick up lunch ingredients. Miso, turnips, avocados. We walked back to the house along the path next to the allotments. Someone had lit a bonfire and smoke was rising into the cold air of this year that still feels brand new to me. <br />
<br />We talked all afternoon about online and offline realities. About how people share everything online except the really big things. Like being scared, or sad, or lonely. About second-guessing your choices in real life because of how they would appear online.
<br />
<br /> We talked about the books we'll write and the people who'll read them and now I'm drinking tea with the cat nagging me and I think I might go back to my draft next week. Might see where the story takes me.
