 <p>Going into the workshop was like going into a cave. The doorway was low; he stooped ahead of her, and she put a hand on either side of the doorframe to steady herself, and followed him in. </p>

<p>The air was cool and it took her eyes a long time to adjust to the darkness. Blind, she sensed the coolness of the cement floor through the thin soles of her shoes. The smell of old apples, of diesel, of wood shavings,and something else, an unidentifiable metal. She could feel him moving ahead of her, opening cupboards and moving things along the floor to make space. She stood very still.</p>

<p>As her eyes adjusted she was able to make out shapes. There was a window in one corner, and it let in a cold grey light. She could see a vast workbench with a vice attached. The wood was very old, pockmarked all over where a great many sharp tools had slipped and gouged holes into the wood. It had a sheen to it, a polish, that gave it a comforting air. She had a sudden image of the flank of some huge animal, a lion or a horse, ancient and strong. On the floor next to the work bench was a large bin overflowing with wood shavings. They curled like ringlets, like giant flat fusilli, and spilled onto the floor.</p>

<p>“Did you want that fixing, then?”
In his hands the frame looked ridiculous, flimsy, flat. 
“Well, only if you can. I don’t want to be difficult.”
The words seemed empty as soon as she said them. How could it be difficult, in this room? How could there not be enough time, enough care, to make sure it was mended?</p>

<p>He set the frame on the ground, tutting as he ran a hand along the splintered edge. She had taken out the photographs, and though it had seemed unnecessary at the time a wave of relief swept over her. The thought of him looking at the pictures of she and Helen peering out from behind their cocktails, of her painted toes on a beach, was too much.</p> 

<p>He said “I’ll have to replace that whole side” and she said “OK”, moving quickly out of his way as he walked in two long steps over to a tall set of drawers, rummaged for a piece of wood. He looked carefully at the selection and then picked one up, comparing it against the other. 
“Needs planing, but that’s almost it.”
She stood back, awed.
He put the piece of wood in the vice and selected a tool from the wall. There were a number of them all hung up on nails. She was ashamed to realise that she couldn’t have named what the thing was. They were made of wood and metal and they all looked very old. He picked one up and with an effort, pushed it along the top of the wood a few times, grunting slightly with the effort. She stood there while he puffed, arms straining in the threadbare sweater.</p> 

<p>Eventually he stood back, and unwound the vice. He went back to the frame and held it up, and was evidently pleased with the result. She wondered whether that was it; he would just put a flat bit of wood in place of the bit that was left. But he went back over to the bench and tightened it into the vice again. She remembered using one at school, the way the handle slid through its hole, making a lever from any angle.</p> 

<p>He took another of the tools from the wall and she noticed that he hung the other one up at the same time. Everywhere there were old icecream tubs and cut off plastic bottles spilling over with nails, offcuts of wood. There were jars and tins lined upon the wall, labels obscured by long ago dark spillages, encrusted with dust. Now a golden light was drifting the through the window, revealing clouds of dust in the air, hanging almost motionless, moved by unseen currents. There were cobwebs thick on the ceiling. But there was nothing out of place, nothing she could see lying around.</p> 

<p>He had already moved with the tool and when he stood back she could see he had carved a regular groove along the edge. The piece of wood would match the rest of the frame now. 
“There’s your bevel” he said, cryptically, and he put it into place. The colour was different but other than that it was a match.
“Might need some paint.”
She felt suddenly inspired by his craftsmanship, she would go to B&Q, she would tie her hair up and put down newspaper. She might even do the chest of drawers while she was at it. Everything seemed possible, here, there were no mysteries in the world, just hard work and thoughtfulness.</p> 

<p>“Thank you so much. Really, it’s so kind of you.” She wondered how long he had lived here, had used this workshop. Perhaps the whole house had once been his, perhaps he had helped to carve it up into flats, to set the locks into the door upstairs, to fit the workshop in the tiny kitchen. She thought about the worksurfaces that didn’t quite meet round the corner, the lino warping on the floor, and thought it unlikely.</p>

<p>As she turned to go, she caught sight of the other workbench. She walked over absently and saw a box on it. A box with en edge grooved like her picture frame, shiny and dark like a conker. It looked familiar, and it took her a moment to realise why. It was a coffin, very small. Maybe a foot long. She was suddenly aware of her heartbeat, in the silence.</p> 

<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“It’s my daughter in law. I had a grandson, didn’t make it. The funeral’s on Thursday.”</p>
She could see the intricate details round the edge; it was nicer than a frame, the wood was silky and rich. She thought about how long it must have taken to get the joins so smooth.</p>
<p>“I’d better get back to it, in fact. If that’s everything.”</p>
<p>She felt that the words she knew how to say were like feathers, like scraps of confetti, flimsy and worthless. </p>
<p>“Thank you. Thank you so much. And, I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>He nodded, held the door open, and she was blinded again by the light. She could hear cars in the street, people talking, next door’s baby crying again. She wondered how much he could hear of her music, of having people over late, cigarettes out of the window on summer evenings.</p>

She left and the door closed and he went back to work on the little box. She felt that in her whole life she would probably never make something as carefully and kindly as the piece he had just fixed. </p>
