<h2>Blogging connects</h2>
</br>You know that blogging's the best way there is to connect online. To build trust, to share your point of view, to welcome potential clients into your world and let them see who you are.
<br/> 
</br>Having a blog on your website means that you can let your people dig deeper into who you are and what you do in their own time. As though you were sitting down and having a leisurely chat over coffee.
<br/> 
</br>When you're self-employed, that's not a luxury. It's how your business flows. Who you are, what you know, what you think, is what makes you stand out. After all,
<br/> 
</br><center><h5>"There is nobody else who is you-er than you."
<br/> 
</br><em>Dr Seuss</em></h5></center>
<br/> 
You know all that, and yet something's stuck. 
<br/> 
</br>Your blog's ground to a halt. Every day that goes past, the last post you wrote is further and further out of date. 
<br/> 
</br>It's starting to feel as though your blog isn't so much a beautiful reflection of your business as an embarrassing hanger-on, telling the world how far behind with your to-do list you are. 
<br/> 
</br>The longer it goes on, the worse you feel. You don't want to publish something that's second-rate or shoddy. Maybe you have a whole folder full of drafts on your computer, but actually getting them into the world will take work, and time, and energy.
<br/> 
</br>Reading other people's blogs just makes it worse. If they're good, you think "Mine could never be as good as that!". And if they're bad, you think "I can't publish any old thing – what if other people read <em>my</em> blog and judge <em>me</em>."
<br/> 
</br>Feels safest to just stay quiet, right?
<br/> 
</br>So you're paralysed. You do nothing. Your blog lurks at the corner of your mind. A big fat "Should Do This" that leaves you feeling guilty and stuck.
</br>
<br/><h3>There is another way</h3> 
</br>Imagine having a clear strategy for your blog – a plan of what content you're going to publish and when. Topics that are funy, and exciting, and the kind of juicy blog that your clients can't wait to share.
<br/> 
</br>Having someone to bounce ideas off, to talk through your plans, and to make suggestions. How about this? Have you thought of putting it this way? If I was your client, I'd like to know all about how you do X.
<br/> 
</br>Maybe you love writing, but you wobble about making it public. Just having someone on side to give your blog a professional edit, a little polish, is what you need. If English is your second language, or you know that spelling and grammar aren't where you shine, then that could be for you.
<br/> 
</br>Or perhaps you're ready to go the whole hog. If business is booming and you know that you can't keep doing everything, or you've got to the point where sitting down to write feels like a unique form of torture, then here's your permission to let go. 
<br/> 
</br>Let someone else come up with the ideas and draft the posts, and you can focus on the things you love to do.
<br/> 
<h3>Blog Bloom</h3>
<br/>I'm passionate about helping self-employed people express themselves wholeheartedly online. I love reading and writing blogs (I've <a href="http://http://quintadias.com/">got</a> <a href="http://madeleineforbes.co.uk/blog.html">two</a>!) and there's nothing I'd like more than to help you with yours. 
<br/> 
</br>I'm qualified – I've got a degree in English from Oxford and I trained as a proofreader. My talent lies in seeing the stories in your work and crafting them into handmade, compelling copy. 
<br/> 
</br>This isn't a one-size-fits-all deal. We'll connect via Skype so that I can really get to know you and your work thoroughly. Seeing as you're struggling with writing I'm not going to ask you to fill out reams of worksheets to tell me who you are. We'll have a chat, and I'll listen and learn, and transform your words into blogs that make you smile.
<br/> 
</br>We'll work on a package of 4 blogs at a time. It's up to you whether you publish them every day for a week; every week for a month; or spread them out over longer periods. During the process we'll generate many more ideas – usually about 3 month's worth of topics, if you blog weekly – and you can keep them to write yourself, or have me take care of them all (is that a sigh of relief I just heard?).
<br/> 
</br>You can treat this as a one month accelerator to inspire you and get you back into your own writing practice. Some people have found that's plenty to get things moving again, especially with the bank of blog topics we'll have generated. 
<br/> 
</br>Or we can work together long term, honing your message and developing a bank of helpful, authentic writing that will make your site come alive. 
<br/> 
<br/>Here's to making your voice heard. 
<br/> 
</br>4 fully written blogs/newsletters: <strong>£250</strong>.
<br/> 
</br>4 of your blogs edited: <strong>£150</strong>.

<a href="mailto: madeleine@madeleineforbes.co.uk" class="btn btn-lg btn-default">Let's start</a>

</br>Tell me who you are and what your work is. Let's get to know each other. 
</br>
</br>(Not into button clicking? My address is madeleine <em>at</em> madeleineforbes.co.uk)
</br>
</br>I'll write back, we'll book in our first Skype and begin making some magic.
