<h2>Writing can be hard</h2>
</br>You start out with great intentions. The words flow; the ideas bubble out.
<br/> 
</br>Then you read it back. It's brilliant! You're a genius. 
<br/> 
</br>You read it again. Ugh. Maybe not. 
<br/> 
</br>This time the words seem fake, false. You imagine someone reading it and sniggering. Are you trying too hard? Maybe it's better to keep it simple. Take out all the flowery stuff.
<br/> 
<br/>Now your site reads like an operator's manual. It's dry as a bone. Even YOU'RE bored by this. 
<br/> 
</br>If only there was someone who could tell you if you're on the right track.
<br/>
<br/><h3>See clearly</h3> 
</br>Imagine having the univided attention of an experienced, objective writer. Someone's who's also in tune with their intuition, who's not going to tell you off for writing how you talk or swearing or veering slightly off course. 
<br/> 
</br>Someone to find the thread in what looks like chaos. To tell you "Yeah, you've got it!" To be honest when their attention wavers, because that's when your clients' attention will wobble, too. 
<br/> 
<br/>Someone honest. And skilled. And kind.
<br/>
<br/><h3>Second Look</h3>
<br/>This is simply my undivided attention on one piece of your copy (could be a page, a blogpost or an email). We'll connect by Skype, first, so that I can get to know you and your work, and you can explain what your aim is.
</br>
</br>Then you'll send me a link to your copy and I'll get to work. Carving out the beautiful thread of meaning. Polishing, editing, tweaking. It's amazing what a professional edit can do to a tangle of words.
</br> 
</br>And you can feel confident that your meaning is clear; you writing is up to standard, and your clients will be head-over-heels in love.
</br> 
</br>Half-hour Skype call + One editing session <strong>Â£50</strong>.
