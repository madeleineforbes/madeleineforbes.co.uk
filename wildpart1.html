  <h3>Wild Camping Part I</h3>

 <p>We’d been going all day across the great, vast, plain. Big looming cloudy skies. Have you ever tried to cycle a fully loaded bike across a wide open space? You don’t really see any of it, you don’t notice the clouds or the sky or the little stumpy olive trees, the church tower of the next town breaking the horizon. All you notice is the wind.</p> 

<p>The wind buffets and blasts, feints, drops, switches. It catches the bike, whenever you take your attention off it. The bikes were heavy, two panniers on each side, giving them a width and a weight that felt like pedalling a brick wall. We’d round a corner by a few degrees, or come out from a little slope that had given some shelter, and bam! After a while, staying at that level of alertness becomes the most tiring thing of all. You get used to the dull dumb ache of cold ears, cold hands. Nick was trying to work out a way to use the wind, to angle his body like a sail so it would propel him forwards. I was just focussing on turning the pedals, one… by…one.</p>  

<p>The guidebook admits there’s not much to say about that part of Spain, the strip below Madrid. It’s Cervantes country, but since Don Quixote was a deluded peasant who spent his time charging at windmills, that’s not to say it’s full of interesting things. It’s hard not to sense a parallel, our expensive bikes loaded up with energy bars and electrolytes, camelbaks for water, the world’s most lightweight tent, spare everything. We had panniers that would probably have survived a journey across Siberia in November, let alone Spain, in early spring.</p>  

<p>But it was bleak, we were still unfit, and there weren’t many cars around out of the tourist season. We were heading South and although it was getting warmer,  it wasn’t yet hot. It had been a long day. We stopped in a  Yepes, a place that seemed to me like all the other villages in Castilla La Mancha. Lots of half built houses in red brick and concrete, gradually getting older and prettier as we spiralled in, following the brown signs to the centre of town and the square with the flags and the church.</p>  

<p>One little shop was still open and that was a real stroke of luck because we were never in time for lunch, or breakfast, or dinner in Spain, meals which fell at strict and counter-intuitive times, so that everything would be closed at two when we needed lunch but there was no chance of supper before ten. Because we were travelling by bike we were starving continually; we ate a lot of nuts and olives in Spain, inhaling handfuls of a salty corn and peanut mix with raisins, washed down with synthetic tasting electrolyte pills dissolved in the plastic water bottles.</p>   

<p>It was freezing, and as we huddled in the lee of the church eating dry bread and cheese and apples it started to hail, half-heartedly, and we didn’t rest too long because we needed to keep moving, to stay warm.</p>  

<p>A few hours before dark, we could see La Guardia in the distance. A little town on a hill. We were already getting the itch to camp. It had been a week or so since we set off from Santander. Every time we packed the panniers it was getting a little bit easier. Our Spanish was improving and we’d hardly had any snow that day, really, and we were ready for adventure like Don Quixote was ready for battle.</p>

<p>Just before the town there was an unpaved track through neat fields off to the right of the long straight road.
