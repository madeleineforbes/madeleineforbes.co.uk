<p>So I just did this proof-reading course. The old fashioned way. Editing for the supremely anal. Proofing isn’t about the sense or the style. It’s “Is that comma in the right font? Are those quote marks in italics? Did you leave two spaces instead of one?”</p>

<p>For a long time, “pays attention to detail” was something I said about myself in job interviews and on application forms. It wasn’t true. What I meant was, I’m a good writer and I’m good at spelling. Which is not the same.</p> 

<p>I found this out because I sucked at the course, and that really threw me. I couldn’t believe how bad I was. But I went to Oxford! I can spell conscientious! I’m a genius! The green pen of my tutor didn’t lie, though. I was terrible.</p> 

<p>I tried really hard. I took my time. I started reading things backwards, one word at a time, to stop my brain distracting me with the story. There is a story in anything, even a textbook, even a technical manual. I read things three, four, five times. I made a checklist. I was methodical. Each time, I spotted more of the things, the commas, the italics, the spacing. I became a little bit obsessed. I’d long since realized that proof reading is a dying art in the age of the web. Or at least, being a freelance proofreader is. Maybe pull requests will give me a new lease of life as a grammatical web warrior of pedantry… maybe not. But I was going to pass if it killed me.</p> 

<p>On the Friday before my birthday, as I was leaving to buy burrito ingredients for the 8 hour car journey, I saw the letter on the doorstep. I did it. I scraped through, probably the worst pass mark I’ve ever got, but a pass. </p>

<p>I’d learned to pay attention to detail. I learned to see what is there, and not what I think is there. At least some of the time. This is a Zen thing - beginner’s mind - and it’s a code thing. Downloading git, I could not get the damn thing to work. I’d made a typing error. One character wrong is all it takes. You have to see what’s there. You have to pay attention. To the detail. </p>

<p>I’m still not there, with the code, with the proofing. I’m trying. I’m learning. I’m failing, and failing again, and failing better - just like the cliche. Clichés are OK for proof readers though, as long as they’re spaced and punctuated correctly. It’s copy editors who don’t like clichés.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I gave Hannah a draft to edit six months ago. She’s good. She’s been giving me razor sharp criticism on my writing for the last ten years now. Clichés don’t stand a chance.</p>

<p>Hannah says, “The trouble with writing is, you know what you mean.” </p>

<p>It’s good advice. The reader isn’t sure what you’re getting at when you say his smile was dusty or his shoulders went down in that way they do, y’know, when they’re kind of tired and… blah blah blah. It’s no good. How can you make them see what you mean? You have to be precise. Same with the machine. If you don’t tell it what colour your navbar should be, or what font you want the buttons in, it won’t know. </p>

<p>Somerset Maugham, whose opinion I respect almost as much as Hannah's, says</p>

<p>“Some writers who do not think clearly are inclined to suppose that their thoughts have a significance greater than at first sight appears. It is flattering to believe that they are too profound to be expressed so clearly that all who run may read, and very naturally it does not occur to such writers that the fault is with their own minds, which have not the faculty of precise reflection.”</p>

<p>So I know what I mean, but it’s a matter of pure ego for me to assume that if you don’t it’s because you’re stupid. If what I mean is expressed precisely, clearly, without padding or faff, then anyone can see what I'm trying to say. The way any computer can understand code, or any typesetter can understand the strange little shorthand symbols proof readers use.</p> 

<p>Another thing I used to say about myself is, “I don’t like maths”. Maths would have included code. But this is also laziness. This is assuming that writing is in some way better, more intuitive, less fixed, than maths is with its rules and equations. More arrogance. It’s not. You write the words and the reader makes the meaning. And yes, words can be tingly, and wonderful, and sexy, and funny. They can make you laugh or cry, or turn on all the lights and the TV late at night when you’re alone in the house, because the chill that just went down your spine was real.</p>

<p>But if you don’t have something clear to say, and if the reader doesn’t get that meaning, then it’s your fault for not being precise or clear enough - for trying to obfuscate the message with fanciness or padding or style. This should not be trusted. Saying “I don’t like maths” is saying “maths is hard”, and the reason it’s hard is because you can’t bullshit. But bullshit doesn’t make writing better. It makes it harder, because it’s easy to fall into. Good writing is like good maths - it’s clear, and transparent, and you can see how they did it, even if you could never have come up with it yourself. </p>

<p>It’s all in the details.</p>
