          <p>
It's not easy to strike out on the path that's calling to you - chuck in the 9-to-5 and the colleagues and the commute and start working for yourself. I've been there, believe me: the self-doubt, the worry, the monster lurking in your belly that tells you "You're a fraud!"
<br />
<br />What saved me was learning that it's OK to be seen as you are. You're enough. What challenged me was peeling away the layers of who I thought I <em>should</em> be, to find who I actually was.
<br />
<br />Now, I love to help others show up wholeheartedly online. When I look at your website I want to hear your voice; I want to see the real you: imperfect, glorious, human. 
<br />
<br />I'm a trained proofreader. I have a degree in English from Oxford. I have a stack of experience helping craft handmade copy for self-employed stars and small businesses. 
<br />
<br />But what actually matters is that I will listen - really listen - to your story, and I'll find the right words to express it, so that others can hear it too.
<br />
<br /><h4>So what's my story?</h4>
<br />
I grew up in London, studied English at University, and worked in local government: the Special Educational Needs department of a busy central London borough. Serving a community of kids and schools and parents, walking by the Thames and spending my salary on eating out and vintage clothes was all I wanted. 
<br />
<br />Then one day it wasn't enough. I thought maybe more studying would save me; I did a Master's. I thought I wanted more money; got promoted. Nope.
<br />
<br />I left the city in 2011 to go travelling by bicycle. Spain, Morocco, Portugal. There was a summer working on a farm, when I reconnected with small, muddy, day-dreamy me.
<br />
<br />When I returned to the UK I spent a couple of years in the East of England. I trusted my intuition, taught myself coding, trained as a proofreader and started freelancing. Getting closer.
<br />
<br /><h4>The leap</h4>
<br />In 2014 I went full-time self-employed, and returned to the hills of central Portugal. There's not much going on here and that's how I like it. 
<br />
<br />Walking in the woods, working the land and swimming in the river fill me up with the energy I need for writing. Eating food I've grown and laughing with people I love soothes my monsters and keeps them safe alongside me.                     
<br />
<br />So I live in a place where the days are soaked by the sun. Without streetlights or power lines. Where the road to my house is unpaved and the only sound at night is the hooting of the owls and the rushing of the river.  <br />
<br />I left behind the neon and the pavements that used to nourish me, craving silence and sanctuary. 
<br />
<br />Now my hands are dirty with soil and my lungs breathe the same air as the olives and the apples and the madronjas trees. Creepers and hoopooes call from the cork oaks and a big blue heron flaps away slowly under the plane trees by the river. 
<br />
<br />I write in my mother tongue and I try to speak a new one, word by word. I'm learning, mais o menos. 
<br />
<br />I've found home. And I help others find theirs, too, and it starts with the truth, and putting the truth into words.
