<br /><h4>Hello, it's nice to meet you.</h4>

<img src="Jan2014.jpg" alt="Madeleine Forbes">
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm a writer, a noticer of the details. I'm more anxious than you'd imagine, if we met, and happier. I like my own company. I'm learning Portuguese. I have been known to take naps during parties. In the words of Bob Dylan:
<br />
<br />Most of the time
<br />Iâ€™m clear focused all around
<br />Most of the time
<br />I can keep both feet on the ground
<br />I can follow the path, I can read the signs
<br />Stay right with it when the road unwinds
<br />I can handle whatever I stumble upon
<br />... Most of the time
<br />
<br />In this space I tell stories about the things I see and the things I imagine. One of my favourite quotes was a title of an essay I wrote as a student. It's Jeanette Winterson: "Trust me, I'm telling you stories." I love the idea that someone doesn't have to be telling the truth for you to trust them. 
<br />
<br />That said, I tend to find myself writing about things that actually happen. Stranger than fiction, and all that.
<br />
<br />This site is an example of digital self-sufficiency. I learnt just enough code to build it, and tweaking it keeps me busy. I'm interested in the practice of writing, the physicality. Pen and paper is king. But if I'm typing this on a keyboard at least I can say I wrote the code by hand. 
<br />
<br />I like all the usual things. Tea, puns, yoga. I ride a bicycle and knit badly. I cook and walk and write things down every single day. 
<br />
<br />When I'm not creating, my work is helping small businesses to grow. I like to support bright stars who are following their passion and making the world a better place. People who are continually growing and learning; people who don't know all the answers and don't expect me to. People who are doing their best, and who expect me to. I'm a natural right-hand woman, a John Watson if you like - I get my kicks knowing that emails are answered, HTML is neat and tidy, tea is on the table and everyone's looked after and happy. 
<br />
<br />I bring a work ethic that's second to none, a fierce attention to detail, and a 100% honest and open approach to how I work. You'll get my very best and if I mess up, because I'm human, I'll tell you and say sorry. It's that simple. 
<br />
<br />As of February 2014 I'm taking a leap and going self-employed full time so if you have an inkling you might love to work with me, get in touch at madeleine(at)madeleineforbes.co.uk 
<br />
<br />If something I've written has touched you, made you smile, filled you with rage or indignation, or just made you remember something that happened to you: I'd love to hear from you too. <a href="mailto:madeleine@madeleineforbes.co.uk">
 Get in touch</a>. Or subscribe, to get to know me a little better, civilised-like. 
<br />
<br />I'll let you know when I publish a new piece here, and you'll get to read the secret stuff I don't want to share in public. Just fill in your email address on the main page. Muito prazer!
<br />
<br />Wednesday 5th February, Cambridge.</p>
