<br /><h4>Hello, I'm Madeleine.</h4>
<br />I'm a writer, a noticer of the details. I'm more anxious than you'd imagine, if we met, and also happier. I like my own company. I have been known to take naps during parties. In the words of Bob Dylan:
<br />
<br />Most of the time
<br />Iâ€™m clear focused all around
<br />Most of the time
<br />I can keep both feet on the ground
<br />I can follow the path, I can read the signs
<br />Stay right with it when the road unwinds
<br />I can handle whatever I stumble upon
<br />... Most of the time
<br />
<br />In this space I tell stories about the things I see and the things I imagine. One of my favourite quotes was a title of the essay I had to write when I studied English. It's Jeanette Winterson: "Trust me, I'm telling you stories." I love the idea that someone doesn't have to be telling the truth for you to trust them. 
<br />
<br />That said, I tend to find myself writing about things that actually happen. Stranger than fiction, and all that.
<br />
<br />This site is an example of digital self-sufficiency. I learnt just enough code to build it, and tweaking it keeps me busy. I'm interested in the practice of writing, the physicality. Pen and paper is king. But if I'm typing this on a keyboard at least I can say I wrote the code by hand. 
<br />
<br />I like all the usual things. Tea, puns, yoga. I ride a bicycle and knit badly. I cook and walk and write things down every single day. 
<br />
<br />When I'm not creating, my work is offering online business support to small businesses. I like to support bright stars who are following their passion and making the world a better place. People who are continually growing and improving; people who don't know all the answers and don't expect me to. People who are doing their best, and who expect me to. 
<br />
<br />I bring a work ethic that's second to none, a fierce attention to detail, and a 100% honest and open approach to how I work. You'll get my very best and if I mess up, because I'm human, I'll tell you and say sorry. It's that simple. 
<br />
<br />As of January 2014 my schedule is pretty packed, but if you'd love to work with me, get in touch att he email address below and let's find out what works. In my experience, if it's right, we'll find a way to work it out. 
<br />
<br />If something I've written has touched you, made you smile, filled you with rage or indignation, or just made you remember something that happened to you: I'd love to hear from you. <a href="mailto:madeleine@madeleineforbes.co.uk">
 Get in touch</a>. Or subscribe, to get to know me a little better, civilised-like. 
<br />I'll let you know when I publish a new piece here, and you'll get to read the secret stuff I don't want to share in public.
<br />
<br />Sunday 19th January, London.</p>

 <h4>A brief history</h4>

<br />In 2011, I quit my job, left my home, and took a ferry to Santander on the north coast of Spain.
<br />
<br />Everything I thought I would need for the next six months in four panniers clipped to my bicycle, the same one I used to ride to work on in London. Eight panniers, including the ones on Nick's bike.
<br />
<br />From there we travelled - mainly by bike, a couple of trains - to Algeciras on the south coast of Spain.
<br />
<br />Then, another ferry to Tangiers. Then, all the way to Marrakesh. No trains this time.
<br />
<br />I'm telling you this not because it's especially interesting or impressive. Interesting things happened to me along the way, of course, but now's not the time for those stories. Not yet. 
<br />
<br />I'm telling you this because that was the point when I decided to start actually living my life by doing the exciting and interesting and frightening things I'd always wanted to. Like writing, and making other peoples' writing better. Getting paid for the work I love and am good at. Instead of waiting for some rose tinted future where my dreams would come true on their own, somehow, if I just put in enough hours at the office.
<br />
<br />You know what they say, one thing leads to another. Tends to be true. Somehow, getting on my bicycle and cycling thousands and thousands of kilometres, led me to this website.
<br />
<br />The blog I started on that trip was on Blogger. 2012 I moved it to Wordpress. 2013, I read <a href="http://git.gwenbell.com/">Git Commit</a>, and started thinking a little harder about the machine I'm writing this on and how it connects to the machine you're reading this on (via a Virtual Private Server in New York, as it happens).<br />
<br />I stopped bullshitting. I learned how to use git. It was hard, and it was worth it. I <a href="code.html">built this site</a> and connected with people and got some clarity. I also got saddled with an unscratchable itch to learn more code, but that's another story.
<br />
<br />So this isn't a sales pitch or an apology. It's how I got here. I'm half way through the first draft of my second novel. And I want to finish it, and more importantly I want to find the work I love, using these skills I've practised since I made that choice. The web for me is no longer status updates and cheesy oneliners. It's a craft.
