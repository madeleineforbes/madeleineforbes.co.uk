      <p>
        
      I'm layering the code on this website, slowly, as I make the transition from being a consumer of the web, to a builder of it. </p>

      <p>It's a journey I'm interested in making in other areas, too. From buying food to growing it. From reading books to writing them.</p>

      <p>I'm not a brave person, or a genius, but I know that if you want something you have to work for it. Change doesn't happen overnight. It's making a committment and sticking to it, tenaciously, and trusting that with time and effort I will gain new skills.</p>

      <p>I'm afraid of lots of things. Being vulnerable online by publishing my personal writing in public is one of them. I lie awake and worry that I won't achieve what I want to in life, that the things I build won't be perfect. But I know that if I succumb to that fear, it will paralyze me. Life is too short not to do the things I want to. The worst that can happen is... I don't know, I guess death is the worst that can happen ultimately, and we're all going to die, so that's a dumb reason not to take risks. Incrementally the time that is fulfilling and joyful expands. I know I'm on the right track because I notice the fear start to lift, like steam off the mountains after the rain.</P>

<p>I write daily and have done since I was a child. I've never found anything I like to do more. But that's not enough, in this world. It's no use writing things if you're not building as well. Coders, you can look me up on github and see how sloppy this code is, how I am feeling my way as I learn. I do not believe in allowing perfectionism to get in the way of starting things.</p>
