                <p>It's been a summer of change. We moved out to Portugal at the start of August and I made the conscious choice to let my business rest. To embrace what was there and not try to change it. Now, I'm ready to come back into this space, and to take the next step that's needed in my work.

                <p>The last time I felt like this, on the edge of something, it was January 2011. A cold winter. Thick snow fell; I remember a magical day in Richmond Park; pristine fields of pillowy white snow. We sledged on pilfered estate agents’ signs and walked through silent copses. And all the time I knew that everything was about to change.

                <p>A <a href="http://youinspireme.co.uk/support-and-resources/community/" target="blank">smart woman</a> once said, "Just because it's called self-employment doesn't mean it has to be by-your-self-employment". 
</br>
Maybe it's no coincidence that I wound up working with someone whose mission is to make self-employment sustainable, profitable and most importantly, sane. Finding my way to peaceful productivity has been my biggest challenge so far.
</br>
Four months in and I want to talk about one of the most important things about being self-employed, and that's this: You don't have to do it on your own.

                <p>It’s what everyone loves to talk about - the Big Why. Why did I go freelance? What led me down this route?

Three months in, I’m starting to feel this urge to come out. To speak more about the truth behind my dreams, and what I want to do with them. 

See, even before going freelance, I knew that I wasn’t after a conventional life. I like adventure too much.

<p>I remember the first one I ever saw, when I interned at New Woman magazine just before I finished school. I was sixteen and the magazine office was impossibly glamorous. Jo Elvin, now Glamour editor, was at the helm and I got to run across the road into Covent Garden, and buy her coffees and toast with peanut butter. There was a radio playing music in the office, and wine from plastic cups on Fridays.</p>
