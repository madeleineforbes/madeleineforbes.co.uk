        <strong>Sunday 21st April 2013 | Nesting</strong></p>
        <p>A good productive day, finished the new chapter and ready to attempt to sneak it into the first part of the book, inconspicuous-like. Built shelves, solved a crossword, baked scones. Kapow!</p>
        <strong>Saturday 20 April 2013 | Sunshine</strong></p>
        <p>Spent far too long feeling like my mood just wasn't living up to the gloriousness of the weather. Cloudless sky, warm spring sun, buds on the trees. Finally, after a long walk through green countryside through thatched villages to distant church spires, I felt peace. The evening featured crab linguine, a spontaneous dance off, real talk about real things: life, death, sex, scones. Man, we got so lucky moving here</p>
     
      <strong> Friday 19 April 2013 | Writing </strong></p>
      <p>
        I laid it all out again on little bits of paper and tried to grasp the flow of it, the pace of it, in my head. I felt stupid and uncomprehending and stuck. I thought what is the point of carrying on with this, this mess that will never be anything?</p>
        <p>Then I sucked it up and wrote another bit of dialogue, even thought it was s-l-o-w. The characters weren't talking. I had to torture it out of them like the Spanish Inquisition. Also wrote up some memories of cycling across Castilla La Mancha in a headwind. Which is similar to how writing felt, today.

      <strong> Thursday 18 April 2013 | An ending, a beginning </strong></p>
      <p>
        Today I erased it all and started again. Deleted the whole caboodle, actually, thanks in part to <a href="http://gwenbell.com/">Gwen Bell</a> who somehow encouraged me to the very edge of the safe rubber dinghy that is blogging on a platform like Wordpress.</p>
        <p> "I can't do it!" I said. "It's frightening! I'm a writer, a thinker, not some kind of tech-y code-y person who builds websites! All the Internet People will sense that and find out and judge me and be angry and throw bitcoins at me!"</p>
        <p>Anyway, I scooched over to the edge of the rubber dinghy, and then I was like, "OK, this is nice. The water looks pretty good from here, especially because I know I don't have to be down with the cold and the seaweed and the sharks."</p>
        <p>"How about I sit on the edge and just dangle my feet in the water of building my own website and still keep my Wordpress blog on the side. Besta both worlds, ya nada?"</p>
        <p>But the water did look good, and it felt good too. There's something about wild swimming. You can't see the bottom, there are currents and rocks and you have to share the water with all kind of unknown critters. But if you've only ever swum in a pool filled with chlorine, policed by lifeguards with whistles, in goggles and a stretchy swimsuit, you haven't really swum. You've gotta dive into the freezing water stark naked and watch leaves floating by and get scared when you put your foot on something squishy. I'm starting to feel like it's a little bit the same with the internet.</p>
        <p> I dunno, maybe I'm not as scared as I think I am most of the time. Or I have some kind of inner ninja who comes out when the real me's busy being neurotic somewhere else. Anyway I jumped. Deleted the whole damn thing with its admin passwords and meta tags and drafts and comments, all that fancy shizzle. I built this site on Twitter Bootstrap which is, where am I now with these metaphors, a life jacket? A float? Something.</p>
        <p>"It's just you and me now, website" I said to my website on this sunny Cambridge afternoon, in the quiet of the library, watching the shadows from the history faculty lengthen towards the lawn.</p>
        <p>You see, I'm going to learn to swim.
