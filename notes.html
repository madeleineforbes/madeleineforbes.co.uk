    <p>Saint Francis de Sales*, most balanced and sane of saints, once wrote that most people when they are in trouble behave like a bird caught under a net, fluttering wildly as it struggles to free itself, only getting more and more enmeshed; if it would only be still it would see that the net has holes in it through one of which it could escape. I had not heard of Saint Francis de Sales then but, as I lay helpless, I began to see I had been exactly like that bird, struggling, struggling, and for what? Only getting to spend. Forced to lie still, I began to see more clearly, and saw what might be a hole of escape. Suppose, instead of living to get money to spend, we lived by not spending? Somewhere away, where it would be so quiet and simple that a little would go a long way? <br>

      If we went to live like peasants in the country we should be rich, rich by being poor.  <br>

      *St Francis de Sales is the patron saint of writers.</p>

<p>I thought: 'I am a restlessness inside a stillness inside a restlessness.'<br>
... After a minute or so, the enclosed stillness started to press on my ears - I thought at first this was a good sign, but nothing interesting happened... I thought that perhaps if I made my mind a blank - <br>
I have often tried - I once had an idea it was a way to foresee the future, but I never got any further than imagining blackness. Sitting on the altar steps, I saw a blacker blackness than ever before, and I felt it as well as saw it - tons of darkness seemed to be pressing on me. Suddenly I remembered a line in a poem by Vaughan: 'There is in God (some say) a deep and dazzling darkness' - and the next second, the darkness exploded into light.</p>

<p>I have put books aside only because I was conscious that time was passing and that it was my business to live. I have gone into the world because I thought it was necessary in order to get the experience without which I could not write, but I have gone into it also because I wanted experience for its own sake.</p>

<p>W. Somerset Maugham, <em>The Summing Up</em> 1938</p>

    <hr>

<p>Somewhat early, but at what age I cannot remember, I made up my mind that, having but one life, I should like to get the most I could out of it. It did not seem to me enough merely to write. I wanted to make a pattern of my life, in which writing would be an essential element, but which would include all the other activities proper to man, and which death would in the end round off in complete fulfillment... The artist can within certain limits make what he likes of his life.</p>

      <p>Who are you online? What are you selling? While the Internet brings more possibility to be sprawling as a personality — to be honest, to embody all aspects of yourself — the Internet has also become a fame machine. You can make Time Magazine’s 140 Great Twitter lists but you need to fit into a category: Fashion! Humour! Sports! You are a multi faceted person but to become a brand within capitalism means defining yourself as narrowly as possible.</p>

        <p>I raged an inner dialogue with myself... I am serious when I say it was a very urgent voice in my head. You cannot be uncomfortable. You cannot be uncomfortable. You cannot be uncomfortable. And maybe this situation is just a mirror of deeper issues in my life, that I’ve grown afraid of being uncomfortable. So this inner dialogue ran on inside me for several days and I am embarrassed to admit, I was actually really torn over it. </p>
        <p>[...]</p>
        <p>This – I think – is the first lesson (and maybe the main lesson) that I am learning in our year of not buying things. It’s okay to be uncomfortable. It’s okay to do without. After a few weeks of worrying and stressing and trying to convince myself... an acceptance settled in and I woke up suddenly it didn’t seem to matter any more. After 6 weeks of not buying non-essentials I am repeating my mantra – it’s okay to be uncomfortable and it’s okay to do without. I am of a generation where those two concepts are very foreign so I have to repeat it a lot. </p>

We three women gather around the kitchen island and begin eating again.  Judy makes us doggy bags to take home, which Ginny and I plan to eat secretly.  We laugh at our husbands stuck in a  4x4 box.
Then we forget about them and just laugh at our own stories.  Ginnie and I consider taking the car home without them.</P

<p>After an hour, the repairman comes and lets the men out of their cage.   Al is sweating, but Tom looks like he's about to faint.  He heads straight for the kitchen sink and drinks a couple of glasses of water.
"It got hot in there," Al said.</p>

<p>Anyway, Tom has had post traumatic stress syndrome since the lock up.  His hands start shaking and he feels faint.</p>

<p>I ate the leftovers the next afternoon without him.</p>

But that was O.K. Knowing we would never see each other again—it was O.K. When you’re young, you think there’ll be plenty of time for everything in your life: counting all the grains of sand in the Sahara Desert, seeing all the people in the world, becoming greater than Jesus and Lenin and Lomonosov and Pushkin and Einstein all rolled into one, reuniting at some point with everyone you’ve met once in your life, befriending every man, falling in love with every woman… </p>
<p>Life is a process of gradually coming to terms with the meaning and the very concept of never-ness. Never—well, so be it. Quoth the raven: oh well, them’s the breaks. Get used to it. Get over it. Life is a perishable proposition of rapidly diminishing returns. You could’ve become this or that; you could’ve been here and there and everywhere; but that didn’t happen—and well, so be it. </p><p>There won’t be, in the end of your life, a joyous, transcendentally meaningful regathering of everyone you’ve ever met on your path, with stories shared and wine flowing and laughter lilting and happiness abounding and life never-ending—well, so be it.</p>

<p>The day was gone. However they might lie awake and cry or ache, they could not claim it back again. Who was it who had said you could not stop days or rivers? </p><p>Harriet could hear the river running in the dark, that was not really dark but moonlight. She shivered. In six or seven weeks perhaps he will go away. She tried to make herself believe that but it did not seem, nor feel, true. What will Bea feel then? wondered Harriet. Will she feel worse than I shall?</p><p> In books people are happy for ever and for ever. But those books are nonsense. Nothing is for ever and for ever, thought Harriet. It all goes away. But does it? Again she was struck by a doubt. Does it all go, be lost and ended - or in some way do you have it still? Could that be true? 'Is everything a bit true?' she had said to Captain John. Then she lost that hope. No. It is gone, thought Harriet. I didn't notice it before, but now I see. I see it - horribly.</p>

          <p>Virginia Woolf said that writing a novel is like walking through a dark room, holding a lantern which lights up what is already in the room anyway. Obstruction, obscurity, emptiness, disorientation, twilight, blackout, often combined with a struggle or path or journey — an inability to see one’s way forward, but a feeling that there was a way forward, and that the act of going forward would eventually bring about the conditions for vision — these were the common elements in many descriptions of the process of writing…Possibly, then, writing has to do with darkness, and a desire or perhaps a compulsion to enter it, and, with luck, to illuminate it, and to bring something back out to the light.</p>

    <p>Within the soul from its primordial beginnings there has been a desire for light and an irrepressible urge to rise out of the primal darkness… The longing for light is the longing for consciousness.</p>
    <p>Carl Jung <em>Memories, Dreams, Reflections, 1963</em></p>

           <p>Experience is stripped of its substance, and instead mere names are substituted, which are henceforth put in the place of reality. No one has any obligations to a concept; that is what is so agreeable about conceptuality - it promises protection from experience. The spirit does not dwell in concept, but in deeds and in facts. Words butter no parsnips; nevertheless, this futile procedure is repeated <em>ad infinitum</em>.Anything can be settled by an intellect that is not subject to the control of feeling - and yet the intellectual still suffers from a neurosis if feeling is undeveloped.</p>
<p>Carl Jung<em> Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em> 1963</p>
