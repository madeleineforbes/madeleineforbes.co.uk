            </br><h2>You've created a service or community which connects and inspires others. </h2>
     Maybe you've written a book with an idea to spread; maybe you're a coach or a teacher, leading others into their best selves.<br/> 
     </br>You're here because you know that you need help to turn your vision into reality. You're not afraid of learning new things; you built your business up from scratch, after all. You're capable of doing this yourself, but you also know that wouldn't be the best strategy. It's important to you that you use your time wisely. 
     </br>
 </br>The idea of outsourcing tasks to a faceless VA doesn't appeal. After all, these aren't just tasks on a list: your blog and communications are the beating heart of your business. They're who you are; why you're here. So you're not <strong>just</strong> looking for someone to be efficient. You'd love to be working with someone you can bounce ideas off; who'll understand the vision you have, and be as courageous as you are in stepping up to make it a reality. </br>
     </br>I can help you implement the vision you've got already, and develop new strategies to communicate with clients and grow your business. <br/> 
                         </br>If you're creative and ambitious but are finding logistics and communication swallow your days, I can help bring clarity. You've worked your socks off to get your business to the point it's at now, and if you can't imagine trusting anyone else to do as good a job, I'd love to talk about how to make your life easier. 
                  </br>             
                  </br>You know that your business can't expand the way it needs to when you're expending all your energy keeping it running the way it should. When you're holding on to every detail, there's no space to dream and grow and create new ways to help your people.

            <h2 class="page-header">Rates</h2>
                <p>My rates are competitive and designed with boutique businesses and self-employed friends in mind.
                </br>
            </br>Because the support I offer is handmade for you, the cost will vary depending on the scope of the work. Business support rates start at Â£25 per hour for stand alone projects.  
        </br>
         </br>Want me on your team for a bigger project, or see if having me on a regular monthly retainer could impact your sucess long term? That's music to my ears. I love building relationships over time and developing the support I offer as your business grows. To prove it, I offer special rates to long term clients. My roster's pretty full for summer 2014, but I'll have new spots available from Autumn onwards.

     </br><h3>But what does that MEAN?</h3>
        </br>It's different for everyone - that's why I call it handmade. I'll work with you to figure out effective approaches and strategies to help your business grow. I won't have all the answers straight away: this is no "one size fits all" magic bullet. You'll tell me what you want, and I'll tell you what I can do, and we'll carve out a path together. I will bring my whole heart to your work and my whole brain to your business. More importantly, I'll take action to implement those strategies, put them into practice, and review them to make sure they're still working.
