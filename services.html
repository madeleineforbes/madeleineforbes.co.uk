<h2>You've created something which connects and inspires others. </h2>
</br>
Maybe you've written a course or e-book with an idea to spread; maybe you're a coach or a teacher, leading others to discover their best selves.
 <br/> 
</br>You're here because you know that you need help to grow your vision into reality. You're not afraid of learning new things; you built your business up from scratch, after all. You're capable of doing this yourself, but it's important to you that you use your time wisely and you've gone as far as you can on your own.
</br>
</br>The idea of outsourcing tasks to a faceless VA doesn't appeal. After all, these aren't just tasks on a list: your blog and communications are the beating heart of your business. They're who you are; why you're here. So you're not <strong>just</strong> looking for someone to be efficient. You'd love to be able to lean on someone you can bounce ideas off; who'll understand the vision you have, and be as courageous as you are in stepping up to make it a reality. 
</br>
</br>I can help take some of the load off your plate - smoothly, seamlessly and in line with your values - and develop new strategies to communicate with clients and grow your business. 
<br/> 
</br>If you're creative and ambitious but are finding logistics and communication swallow your days, I can help bring clarity and get you back to your creative space. You've worked your socks off to get your business to the point it's at now, and if you can't imagine trusting anyone else to do as good a job, I'd love to talk about how to make your life easier. 
</br>             
</br>You know that your business can't expand the way it needs to when you're expending all your energy keeping it running the way it should. When you're holding on to every detail, there's no space to dream and grow and create new ways to help your people. 
                  <h2>So, this is your invitation to let go.</h2> 
</div>
   <div class="col-md-4">    
            <h2 class="page-header">Rates</h2>
                <p>Support costs will vary because we'll agree a bespoke package that's just for you. My starting point is a base rate of Â£25 per hour.  
        </br>
         </br>Want me on your team long term? That's music to my ears. I love building relationships and developing the support I offer as your business grows. My roster's pretty full right now but I keep a list of clients who are keen to get started.

     </br><h3>But what does that MEAN?</h3>
      Honestly, it's different for everyone - that's why I call it handmade. I'll work alongside you to figure out effective strategies to maintain the work you've done already and help your business grow. I won't have all the answers straight away: this is no "one size fits all". You'll tell me what you want, and I'll tell you what I can do, and we'll carve out a path together. 
      </br>
  </br>I bring my whole heart to my work and my whole brain to your business. We'll make a plan, put it into practice, and then review it at regular intervals to check we're on the right path.
