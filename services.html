<h2>Writing your website can feel like being lost in the woods.</h2>
</br>You know where you want to end up: with a site that's clear, professional, interesting. That really speaks to people. And there's plenty to keep you busy on the path: you love what you do, love explaining the reason for your work and the approach you've honed. 
 <br/> 
</br>But the clarity just isn't there. You can't quite see how you'll get to where you long to be. 
<br/> 
</br>You don't just want to list your services and your experience. You want to really speak to people, to be real, human, professional, and relatable. To build a brand that's authentic and sustainable.
<br/> 
</br>For your future clients to get a sense of who you <em>really</em> are. To understand what you do. 
<br/> 
</br>Your work is transformative. You're doing good in the world. But it's not magic. You have an approach that you've spent years honing, and you want to sum that up without sounding flaky, cheesy, or like everyone else on the web. 
 <br/> 
</br>You have brilliant ideas, and maybe you even love writing - but when you read the words back, something about your About page, or the services you offer, just doesn't resonate.
<br/> 
</br>So you start again, one more time, from the top - and you're back in the woods again.
<br/> 
</br> Writing your website is taking so much time! Time that could be spent working with clients, connecting, creating - doing the things you love to do. 
 <br/> 
</br><h3>Finding the right path</h3>
</br>I've spoken to loads of entrepreneurs who find it hard to put their work into words, so I get it. It's not that you don't enjoy explaining what you do. 
<br/> 
</br>But you get tired of repeating yourself and you hate the fact that the words you use are starting to sound tired, too. You wish your website could act as a virtual host, welcoming people in and showing them around. You, but you on your best day: bright and open-hearted and delighted to welcome people in.
<br/> 
</br>But the thought of having someone else write for you doesn't seem realistic. What if they can't get your style? What if you sound even less authentic?
<br/> 
</br>
You want to be involved - you enjoy the process. It would just be great to have someone on your side who'd take the time to get to know you and your craft, who'd get excited about finding the right words. 
<br/> 
</br>Someone you could throw your jumble of ideas at and would be able to pick out the silver thread that connects them, and hold it up for you to look at. 
<br/> 
</br>Someone who'd give you honest, objective feedback. 
<br/> 
</br>Someone with standards as high as yours, to help reflect back the impact you're making, so that your right clients will find you and know they're home.
<br/> 
</br><h3>Take my hand</h3>
<br/> 
It's time to find the truth in what you're doing, and bring it out into the world. 
</br>
</br>
Imagine having a writing ally with the right words at their fingertips. Someone who believes in what you're doing and is excited to discover what's unique about you and byour work. Imagine being able to get feedback on from an experienced writer and editor; to start a collaborative journey with someone you could return to in future. 
</br><h3>A writer to work with you</h3>
 
</br>I've been writing since I was very small. Words are more than my passion. They're how I appreciate and make sense of the world. I have a degree in English Language and Literature from Oxford University.
<br/> 
<br/>
And I love clear communication. In fact, I think it's the most powerful tool we have. My Masters dissertation at King's College, London focussed on how collaborative working happens in schools. I learned that boundaries dissolve and magic happens when we put down the jargon and "how it's meant to be done" and tell our stories openly, from the heart. 
<br/> 
<br/>
 I'm energised by connecting dots, discovering threads, opening up the intuitive knowledge we hold and the desire to share who we are with others. 
 <br/> 
</br>Now, I work with small businesses helping people make the most of their lives and careers. I'm the one people turn to when they wonder "what's the right word?". My favourite thing in all the world is to weave some magic, set a scene and <a href="http://www.quintadias.com" target="blank">share a story</a>. And I'd love to help you tell who you are. 
<br/> 
</br>
<h2>Express Your Essence</h2>
<br/> 
Express your essence is a package of two Skype calls and two rounds of revisions. We'll dig deep into who you are, what you do and why, and we'll come up with <strong>three</strong> fully written and edited web pages - typically your home page, about page and sales/service page - for your site. 
<br/> 
</br>The cost for the full process, plus an extra "wildcard" Skype consultation and edits for a page of your choice at any point in the following six months, is <strong>Â£250</strong>.

</br>
</br>
<a href="mailto: madeleine@madeleineforbes.co.uk" class="btn btn-lg btn-default">Let's start</a>
</br>
</br>
Tell me who you are and what your work is. Let's get to know each other. 
</br>
</br>
I'll write back, asking you for some logistics: If our schedules match up, then it's a date. I'll send you the details you need to transfer over payment, we'll agree a schedule, and begin making some magic.
</br>
</br>And! After our wild wordsmithing romance, we'll have got to know each other so well. Don't you think it would be a tragedy if we never spoke again? I do. 
</br>
</br>So I'm throwing in a wildcard - <strong>a half hour Skype, plus an hour's worth of edits, on writing of your choosing</strong>. Re-writing your about page in a few month's time to reflect your new direction? Got a doozy of a blog post that's going to shake the world up (but could do with a second opinion)? Ping it over at some point <strong>in the next 6 months</strong>, and we'll give it a blast of writing love. 
</br>
</br>
Ready? I couldn't be happier. Just click the button below, send me that email, and we'll do this.
