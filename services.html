<h2>Writing your website can feel like being lost in the woods.</h2>
</br>You know where you want to end up: with a site that's clear, professional, interesting. That really speaks to people. And there's plenty to keep you busy on the path: you love what you do, love explaining the reason for your work and the approach you've honed. But the clarity just isn't there. You can't quite see how you'll get to where you long to be. 
 <br/> 
</br>You don't just want to list your services and your experience. You want your site to really speak to people, to come across as human, professional, and relatable - for your future clients to get a sense of who you <em>really</em> are. To understand what you do. And your work is transformative. You're doing good in the world. But it's not magic. You have an approach that you've spent years absorbing, and you want to sum that up without sounding flaky, cheesy, or like everyone else on the web. 
 <br/> 
</br>You have brilliant ideas, and you love writing - but when you read the words back, something about your About page, or the services you offer, just doesn't resonate. You start again, go from the top - and you're back in the woods again. Writing your website is taking so much time! Time that could be spent working with clients, connecting, creating - doing the things you love to do. 
 <br/> 
</br><h3>Finding the right path</h3>
</br>I've spoken to loads of entrepreneurs who find it hard to put their work into words, so I get it. It's not that you don't enjoy explaining what you do. But you get tired of repeating yourself and you hate the fact that the words you use are starting to sound tired, too. You wish your website could act as a virtual host, welcoming people in and showing them around. You, but you on your best day: bright and open-hearted and delighted to welcome people in.
<br/> 
</br>Right now it can actually feel embarrassing to direct a client to your site (if you even give them the link in the first place). You're a professional, after all. You want things to be right. If you added up all the time spent in front of the screen, it's cost you an awful lot already. But the thought of having someone else write for you doesn't seem realistic. What if they can't get your style? What if you sound even less authentic?
<br/> 
</br>
So you've put in the hours, maybe even taken a copywriting course. You've been doing it all yourself. And you want to be involved - you enjoy the process. It would just be great to have someone on your team. Someone who'd take the time to get to know you and your craft, who'd get excited about finding the right words. Someone you could throw your jumble of ideas at and would be able to pick out the silver thread that connects them, and hold it up for you to look at. Someone who'd give you honest, objective feedback. Someone with standards as high as yours, to help reflect back the words you've written and tell you - honestly - how they land. 
<br/> 
</br><h3>Take my hand</h3>
<br/> 
It's time to take a collaborative approach. To draw a line and finally find a message that works. You need someone to meet you where you are and take your hand. To venture deeper into the woods and bring you back out again into the sunlight, to show who you are to the world. 
</br>
</br>
Imagine having someone on your side. An ally, with the right words at their fingertips. Someone who believes in what you're doing and is excited to discover what's unique about you and bring it into the light. Imagine being able to get feedback on your work from an experienced writer and editor; to start on a collaborative journey with someone you could return to in future. 
</br><h3>A writer to work with you</h3>
 
</br>I've been writing since I was very small. I have stacks of journals to show that words are how I make sense of the world. I love words so much I did a degree in English Language and Literature at Oxford University - three years of delving deep into language, connecting with its roots and beginnings, and of scaling its heights up to the tip top of the tallest branches.  
<br/> 
<br/>
And I love clear communication. In fact, I think it's the most powerful tool we have. My Masters dissertation at King's College, London focussed on how teachers work with other professionals in schools - think speech therapists working with class teachers - and the interviews I carried out told me that it's all about communicating, openly. Boundaries dissolve and magic happens when we put down the jargon and the "how it's meant to be done" and tell our stories openly, from the heart. 
<br/> 
<br/>
 I'm energised by connecting dots, exploring connections, opening up the intuitive knowledge we hold and the desire to share who we are with others. Now, I work with small businesses helping people make the most of their lives and careers. I'm the one people turn to when they wonder "what's the right word?". My favourite thing in all the world is to weave some magic, set a scene and <a href="http://www.quintadias.com" target="blank">share a story</a>. And I'd love to help you tell who you are. 
<br/> 
</br>
<h2>Express Your Essence</h2>
<br/> 
Express your essence is a package of two Skype calls and two rounds of revisions. We'll dig deep into who you are, what you do and why, and we'll come up with <strong>three</strong> fully written and edited web pages - typically your home page, about page and sales/service page - for your site. 
<br/> 
</br>The cost for the full process, plus an extra "wildcard" Skype consultation and edits for a page of your choice at any point in the following six months, is <strong>Â£250</strong>.

</br><h4>The Process</h4>
</br>Your first step? Click this button and send me an email. 
</br>
</br>
<a href="mailto: madeleine@madeleineforbes.co.uk" class="btn btn-lg btn-default">Let's start</a>
</br>
</br>
Tell me who you are and what your work is. Let's get to know each other. 
</br>
</br>
I'll write back, asking you for some logistics: what are you looking for? When do you want to do this? If our schedules match up, then it's a date. I'll send you the details you need to transfer over payment, we'll agree a schedule, and begin! You'll have a brief form to complete with the bare bones of your project, and I'll start work on painting a picture in words. 
</br><h4>Stage One</h4>
We'll have a <strong>Skype call</strong>, video and all, so we can make eye contact and smile at each other and the alchemy will begin. Over a cup of tea, we'll have a good long chat about who you are and why you're here.
<br/> 
</br>We trust that you're exactly where you need to be and that this moment brings us all we need to know. We'll get real: What are your fears? Your dreams? What do you want your clients to feel? What actions will they take on each page of your site? What have you written already, and what do you wish you had the words to say? By the end of the call, we'll have a map of where we want to go.
</br>
</br>Energised and inspired, I'll dive into copywriting. If you've already started, I'll use that. If you're at "blank page" stage - delicious possibility! - I'll cook up something from scratch (my cupboards are always full). <strong>In a week's time, I'll send you a document with the first draft of your three pages</strong>.
</br>
</br>Oh, the joy when you see what I've written. It's as tingly a moment as an email attachment can ever bring you. But it's not perfect. All of a sudden you'll see the bits I've missed out, the extra details you'd like to highlight. I'll have chosen a word you don't like the look of, or hidden one you love three paragraphs down, when you'd like it to be right at the top. 
</br><h4>Step Two</h4>
<strong>Our second call</strong>. I'll wear my thickest woolly jumper as you pelt me with suggestions, edits and ideas for improvements. (We'll laugh about it later). And off I'll go again, to my mountain lair...
</br>
</br>... where version two is born. 
</br>
</br><h4>Stage Three</h4>
Mmm, that's more like it. Once more, <strong>you'll get the first viewing of the second draft via email</strong>. We're getting closer now, ironing out the kinks. 
</br>
</br>This round of edits we'll do in writing - we're moving towards the final version of your website, and hand-gestures won't cut it any more. So <strong>you'll send me any edits you want as track-changes to the document, via email</strong>. 
</br>
</br><h4>Stage Four</h4>
Finally, a week after I receive your edits, <strong>I'll send you the finished product</strong>. We'll give it a final polish, to make sure you're totally happy with what I've come up with.  
</br>
</br>You'll jump for joy, breathe a huge sigh of relief,  cross "write website copy" off your to-do list and upload the text onto your site. High five!
</br>
</br>And! After our wild wordsmithing romance, we'll have got to know each other so well. Don't you think it would be a tragedy if we never spoke again? I do. So I'm throwing in a wildcard - <strong>a half hour Skype, plus an hour's worth of edits, on writing of your choosing</strong>. Re-writing your about page in a few month's time to reflect your new direction? Got a doozy of a blog post that's going to shake the world up (but could do with a second opinion)? Ping it over at some point <strong>in the next 6 months</strong>, and we'll give it a blast of writing love. 
</br>
</br>
Ready? I couldn't be happier. Just click the button below, send me that email, and we'll do this.
