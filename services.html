<h2>So what you say, and how you say it, matters.</h2>
</br>I'm creating a new service to help creative people put their work into words. 
 <br/> 
</br>If you love writing but just can't seem to describe yourself or your business in the way you want to... this is for you. 
 <br/> 
</br>Maybe you're doing something that's at the intersection of one or more disciplines. Maybe the websites of your peers all use the same, tired words to describe what they do... and you're ready to break the mould (but could do with some support being your real, bold, self). 
<br/> 
</br>Or you've been in business a while, you've read your "About" page approximately one million times (it's a hodge-podge of every niche and every service you've ever had, isn't it?) and you need a fresh eye to go over it. 
<br/> 
</br>
Maybe you're just starting out and you'd like a site that you know is setting you on the right path to that five, ten year vision. 
<br/> 
</br>You're definitely creative, open minded, and ready to connect with someone who values your authenticity and the quality of the writing on your website as much as you do. You have high standards and you also want there to be a bit of magic going on. For people to read what you do and not just take action, but actually feel like they've been touched in some way. Moved. Held. Seen. 
<br/> 
</br>If you want to be the first to hear when I launch my service, then hit the button below to drop me an email and I'll let you know when it's ready. 
<br/> 
</br>
It's time to show up. To tell your story in the way that feels right. To get real. 
<br/> 
</br>
(And you don't have to do it alone)
