<br />Hello, friend
<br />
<br />I'm writing this from my sister's house in London. I want to <a href="www.madeleineforbes.com">share my latest piece with you</a>; I wrote about the end of the last year, which I spent out on the islands on the west coast of Scotland. 
<br />
<br />It was a slow, magical, beautiful twilight. I switched off; I did not go online. I read, and wrote, and slept, and laughed, and cried, and loved.
<br />
<br />I was so moved by the responses I got to my last piece. I'm still working through some of what you shared, imagining how I might tweak it. This is what writing is all about in the digital age. 
<br />
<br />I'm at a turning point, too, a transformation. I can feel changes on their way, and I'm excited to share them with you as they unfurl, in ways I can't yet imagine.
<br />
<br />Rummaging in my bag this week I found something hard and plastic. A compass, left over from our times on the islands. It made me smile, because I'm carrying with me my own compass at the moment. A deep sense of knowing where I want to go, and of choices that support it. 
<br />
<br />We're 20 days in to this year, and I'm feeling positive. Is your year going well? Have you set mantras or intentions to guide you on your way? Drop me a line and let me know.
<br />
<br />Be bright,
<br />Madeleine
