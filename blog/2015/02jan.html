<p>
In fact, one of my oldest friends confessed a few years ago that aged five or six, she used to hide the books in her bedroom before I came round. Otherwise we'd go up to play and I'd vanish into a story instead, lost for hours. 
</br>
</br>Stories were my escape and when I got older, it was writing things down that helped me process what was going on in my world. Travelling, learning, loving and losing. 
</br>
</br>I love writing, it's who I am. But writing for the web is a different deal. 
</br>
</br>The uncensored journalling housed in the big bag of notebooks behind my clothes rail isn't what I want to share with the world. But the writing skills I learned at University don't work either.  I've read academic writing online, and it hurts my eyes. We want short sentences when we read on a screen. Subheadings. Bullets. The white space is as important as the words. 
</br>
</br>So when this new style is combined with writing about myself, publically, it's a recipe for giving up. I sit down to write my About page and the voices in my head clamour (yours too?)
</br>
</br>Is this OK? Am I OK? Have I shared too much? No, that's really bland. That sounds the same as everyone else. Gotta make it personal, quirky. What do I like? Cupcakes? Doesn't everyone? Food, then? I care about the planet? I want us all to be happy? No, that's silly. Argh, it's starting to sound really woo-woo. Is this finished? Am I going mad? Will anyone care?
</br>
</br><h3>The easiest and the hardest thing</h3>
</br>Eventually - and believe me, I've done this on many occasions - you read your own website so much, trying to make it perfect, that you can't see it any more. The words start to swim and you've forgotten what the reason for all this was in the first place. The thought of a stranger reading it and connecting with you in any way - of seeing who you are - seems bonkers. Laughable.
</br>
</br>So what's the remedy?
</br>
</br>It's the same as most things, really. The hardest and the easiest thing in the world: practice. 
</br>
</br>I've been experimenting with blogging and writing to the web since 2010, on many a now-defunct Wordpress site. Gradually I've learned not to cringe at the sight of my words on screen; to get a feel for what looks right. Trial and trial and error and error, and trusting that I'm doing the best I can, each time I write. 
</br>
</br>
What you do offline matters, too. This year I've returned to Morning Pages. Starting my day with three pages of freeform journalling, pouring out anything and everything that springs to mind - from reminiscing about long-gone people and events, to ranting about current situations or musings on the morning sunlight or my cat. 
</br>
</br>Giving yourself freedom to write things down without editing or tweaking or thinking about an audience is a powerful way to tap into the creative well, to flex your muscles. 
</br>
</br>Like running, writing's about keeping going and not being afraid to push onwards, even though it's hard sometimes. 
</br>
</br><h3>Nothing is finished, nothing is fixed</h3>
</br>The other key is to remember the beauty of working online, as compared to a manuscript or a book or a dissertation: Nothing is fixed. Nothing is finished. 
</br>
</br>In fact, the websites I like best are ones that are being updated and changed all the time. Ones where the pages reflect the person behind them, beautifully and imperfectly and in ever-changing reality. 
</br>
</br>So take heart. Be vulnerable. Be honest. Trust your taste, and your judgment, and that if you're really yourself then others will respond. 
</br>
</br>
If you want help with writing your website, then I'd love to work with you to find the words that really reflect who you are. Just <a href="../../services.html" target="blank">click here to find out more</a>.
