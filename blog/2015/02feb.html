I've come down with some kind of virus in the past 24 hours, and what was I doing doing at 8pm yesterday evenig, as I laid in bed, propped up on pillows with ginger steeping in a mug of hot water beside me? Tweaking this site - changing a bit of wording there, adding a better description there. So if even professional writers endlessly find things to change in their copy, how on earth can you know when it's time to walk away and say - that's finished? 
</br>
</br>Here are my 3 tips for learning when to walk away.   
</br>
</br><h3>Set a limit</h3>
How long does it take to write an About page? A homepage? A tweet? Well, as the saying goes, how long is a piece of string? It could take a lifetime to carefully compose a perfect haiku, encapsulating everything that needs to be said about a fundamental zen concept. Years to craft a perfect description in a novel. 
</br>
</br>But you don't have years. You want your website to welcome in your readers, and show them who you are so that they can connect with you and become your paying clients. 
</br>
</br>So the first step is to set a limit. When do you want to have your copy done by? Put it in your diary. Then, give yourself a chunk of time to work in - a few hours maybe, or an afternoon. Plan to write on one day, and then take a break. I like to leave at least the same amount of time to edit and polish my work before hitting publish. 
</br>
</br>A deadline is a good motivator, and at the end of that time, promise yourself that you'll call it a day and be happy with what you've done. You might want to schedule in another block the following month - just an hour or so - to re-write and make any tweaks. Over time, you'll arrive at something you're happy with. 
</br>
</br><h3>Be happy with Good Enough</h3>
I used to work in Special Educational Needs. I learned so much from seeing how adaptations to learning for kids with additional needs apply to every day life. Because aren't we all unique in our own ways? Doesn't it help all of us to embrace the quirks and individualities that make us who we are?
</br>
</br>People with autism can struggle to pick up concepts that neurotypical children learn without thinking. One of those is the idea of "Good enough". Instead, some of them see the world in black and white terms; right or wrong.
</br>
</br>I had an "aha" moment when I first saw an Educational Psychologist's report stating that a kid needed to learn the concept of "Good Enough". It's something that's stuck with me. Good Enough means not obsessing and fixating on getting something 100% right. It means saying, this isn't perfect, but it's OK. It gets my message across. 
</br>
</br>So in writing an "about" page, your aim is to describe who you am and what you do. If you've done that, it's good enough - even if it's not perfect.  
</br>
</br>I love the Japanese concept "<a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi" target="blank">wabi-sabi</a>". Essentially, it means finding beauty in the imperfect or decaying. The cracked patina of a beautiful old piece of ceramic; the way the pages of a favourite book are worn and soft. If it's hard to think about Good Enough, try and see beauty in the first drafts. Perfection in the imperfection.
</br>
</br><h3>Accept that nothing is ever finished</h3>
Living out here in the countryside, I notice more and more how the landscape changes. In some ways, the view from my house is the same every day: trees, birds, vines, river. There are no billboards to switch out or new shops to open. 
</br>
</br>And yet, it's always different, too. The sky colours grey before rain; blue when the clouds part; pink at sunset. Birds build nests; trees sprout leaves and drop them in the autumn. The river rises and falls; sometimes it's clear and glassy green; sometimes it churns and rages. The landscape is never "done", nothing is fixed, nothing will be the same forever.
</br>
</br>I like to think of the web, too, as a living ecosystem. As you read and re-read your site, as you start to get feedback on what's helpful and what's not, you'll adapt and edit your copy. That's OK. It's a reflection of you, after all, and humans don't stay still: we grow and learn and regenerate and our tastes and values shift and grow. 
</br>
</br>It's OK to accept that your site will change and that it's never totally "finished". Letting go of the idea of a fixed, final version can be the first step to moving forward with the other things on your to-do list.
</br>
