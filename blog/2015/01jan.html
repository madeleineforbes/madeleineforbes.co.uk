                <p class="lead">Showing Up are two words I've seen a lot online, and the truth is I always used to wonder what they meant exactly.</p>
<p>
I know the meaning literally - to show up. To be present somewhere. But what did people mean when they talked about "Showing Up" in business?
</br>
</br>Showing Up at my old job meant cycling in, even when it was raining or snowing or just bitterly, bitterly cold. Meant saying "Morning!" to the security guards and letting myself into the office and making a cup of tea. It meant if someone came past with a question I'd be sitting there; it meant calling my boss if I was sick and telling her "I'm staying in bed today."
</br>
</br>Now? There's no cycle to work, no security, no cleaner or receptionist to ask how my weekend was. 
</br>
</br>But I'm at the computer every day. I'm here in my pajamas, or my jeans. Actually, this time of year I'm wearing leggings underneath and two hats and the woolly scarf my mum got me for Christmas. 
</br>
</br>And if you popped in with a question I'd make you a cup of tea and see how I could help.
</br>
</br>I'm thinking about my work, dreaming it, living it. Trying my hardest. Writing every day, honing my craft, figuring out how the most authentic people I know share themselves so wholeheartedly with a bunch of strangers online. But this "Showing Up" thing is different. Is there a card I have to punch somewhere, I wondered, a timesheet to submit? Someone I'm supposed to say hello to?
</br>
</br>
So I decided showing up just wasn't for me. Maybe I hadn't taken the right course yet. It didn't apply. And in a way, I was right. I wasn't ready for it. It's not until I started sharing more of my life online that I understood.
</br>
</br><h3>You must ask for what you really want</h3>
</br>I've had this Rumi quote pinned to the noticeboard on my desk for a few months now. Its about waking in the small hours and listening. 
</br>
</br>
<em>"The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you. 
    </br>Don't go back to sleep. 
    </br>You must ask for what you really want. 
    </br>Don't go back to sleep. 
    </br>People are going back and forth across the doorsill, where the two worlds touch. 
    </br>The door is round and open. 
</br>Don't go back to sleep."</em>
</br>
</br>
<strong>You must ask for what you really want.</strong> 
</br>
</br>
These are the words that rang in my ears in the cold dawns towards the end of 2014.
</br>
</br>
Showing up means more than a twitter profile or a website. Showing up means showing who I really am - even when I'm scared or confused, or I don't know what's going on. It means asking for what I really want. Looking at myself and my work honestly, and seeking help when I need it. It means being really truthful about the parts of my day I don't like, and taking steps to change them. 
</br>
</br>It means really being present. Getting up on Sunday morning to carry buckets of concrete for my friend's building project. Getting that crazy hairstyle I've been talking about trying for a while (and putting a picture of it at the top of this post).
</br>
</br>Launching <a href="../../services.html" target="blank">a new service</a> and finally admitting that creativity is something I want more of in my life. 
</br>
</br>(And I think support to write authentically about who you are and what you do is something you need more of in yours.) 
</br>
</br><h3>It's hard to show you who I am</h3>
</br>
Showing up is simple really, and at the same time it's really hard. All those old demons come flooding back. All the times I've shown who I really am - at school, at work, at that party that one time with the people I didn't know so well - and been laughed at or put down. 
</br>
</br>I remember when I told an old colleague I was leaving to go travelling and she told me "If you leave now, you'll be committing career suicide." 
</br>
</br>I felt so stupid and so small for wanting something more. 
</br>
</br>It's that kind of thing that sticks in my throat when I think about showing up again. That meakes me want to stay quiet, small, under the radar. And leads me to make those weird rules: It's OK so long as I don't use my real name. It's OK so long as I don't use a photo,  so long as no one knows what my dreams really look like. 
</br>
</br><h3>Enough.</h3>
</br>Just speaking out loud our desires can be a powerful thing. Acknowledging those little pockets of fear, of doubt, that stop us stepping forward. Being real. Being heard. 
</br>
</br>
So here's to showing up in 2015. I'm looking forward to getting to know you. I'll be over on Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/mforbes_" target="blank">come and say hello</a>.
</br>
</br>And while you're at it, change your profile picture to one that looks like you. It's a good first step.
