                <p class="lead">Last weekend I watched my best friend get married, for the second time in a month. To the same person both times, I'm delighted to say. It got me thinking about the risks we take in opening ourselves - our families - up to new encounters.</p>

<p>The first was a gorgeously English affair, a wildflower strewn, bohemian romp in a Suffolk field. They exchanged vows in front of an international assemblage; a twelfth century church lit with saris and smiles. We sang songs at the top of a meadow in the evening sun, in front of an arch threaded with dog roses, and danced the starry night away to a ceilidh band til my shoes gave out.

    </br> 
</br>This one, the second, was the Indian reception. I flew into Madras and walked through the doors of the airport and stepped into another planet. Colour. Heat. Noise. On Saturday night, rituals and blessings at the groom's house. I welled up as Geraldine lit a lamp in the family home, to symbolise the light their union brought. I sweated in a borrowed sari at the intimate dinner- just 60 or 70 close friends and family - in a nearby hall. More laughter, more rituals, more noise, more delicious food, served from banana leaves sprinkled with water and slurped from my fingers as the waiting staff gazed and took photos. 
</br> 
</br>
<h4>Open to grow</h4>
</br>Saturday night brought an opulent reception in a plush 5-star hotel. The fanciest place I've ever been in, by a long shot. Miles of air-conditioned marble and glittering chandeliers. A stage on which the couple posed for four hours of photographs. Guests included University Professors and Chiefs of Police, tribal villagers from the hills where my friend works, family stretching out to cousins of cousins of cousins, a handful of Brits. 
</p> 
<p>On a sweltering Madras evening, in saris and jeans and suits, flipflops and stilettoes and bare feet, classes and clutures and expectations collided. Created something beautiful, someting united around love, and good wishes, and making an effort and stepping outside one's comfort zone. A wedding's just flower arrangements, just details, without a willingness to open up. To talk to people beyond your family, your village, your city, your culture. A family opens and accepts a stranger as one of them and this is true of all weddings, not just cross-cultural ones. 
</br> 
</br>But you have to be willing to take the leap. I told myself that as I took a deep breath and tried not to trip over my sari and prepared for second-language smalltalk in the 40 degree heat. You put on your best clothes and you make conversation with aunties and grandparents, and most of the communication takes place in eyes meeting and big smiles and soft hands gripping yours and it all comes together, somehow, every time.  
</br> 
</br>
<h4>It only works if you show up</h4>
</br>
This is where working online is like a wedding. It only works if you show up. Put on your best clothes and take a deep breath and accept - really accept - that everything's not always going to go exactly as planned. It might pour with rain, virtually speaking, or the vegetable pilau might be bland and that's even before you've thought about who'll show up and what baggage they'll bring and whether they'll get along with each other, and will they talk about it afterwards, will they judge. 
</br> 
</br>You can't escape that, no one can. That's life; that's the universe unfolding in its own glorious messy way. But you'll never make any magic without the deep breath, and the showing up, and the love
</p>
