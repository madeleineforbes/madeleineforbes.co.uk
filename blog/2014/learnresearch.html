                <p class="lead">I did research once before, for my Masters degree, and it was nothing like this. Back then, I carried out 45 minute interviews where I asked exactly the same questions each time - even down to the prompts I gave if someone wasn't sure how to answer - that had been approved in advance by an ethics committee. 
</p> 
<p>
I transcribed each interview and spent weeks trawling through, highlighting themes and repeated words. It was robust and informed by proper qualitative rsearch principles, and it was <em>nothing at all</em> like the interviews I've been doing these past couple of weeks.
<br />
<br />
This is a rawer, more instinctive way of working. I'm following my intuition a lot, going with the flow, trusting that I'll discover exactly what I need to. I've connected with some amazing people. One thing that's blown my mind is how spontaneously a rapport can spring up between two people who've never met before. But so many of the people I've interviewed have clicked with me in that indefiniable way. It's a sign I'm on the right track. <em>Yes</em>, I think, <em>I want to do this work</em>. 
<br />
<br />There are some similarities with the research I did for my dissertation back in 2010. One of the principles that I loved back then, and still do now, is that of allowing the data to speak to you. And by data, I mean "words people have said".  
<br />
<br />
So, I've tried not to approach these interviews with too many assumptions. I'm trying to reallylisten to what people are telling me, to really hear what's out there, what's being asked for, how I can help. Rather than having a product or a service in mind, and selecting people who will nod and say "That's great", I'm trying hard to crack myself open and allow the needs to be hard. So I can design a service which will meet them. 
<br />
<br />For example: I asked people to participate if they "struggle to put the work they do into words". Beforehand, I'd had this idea that I would be interviewing people who hated writing. Who would be looking for a copywriter to wave a magic wand and ping! There would be their website copy, all written out and edited, without them having to lift a finger. 
<br />
<br />
As it turns out, the majority of people I've interviewed have told me "I love writing!" or "I'm really good at writing". I've interviewed people who write weekly blogs, or columns in magazines, or who help their friends out with their writing.  
 <br />
<br />So the idea of me whisking their about page off and returning it with all the words in place? It doesn't actually sound that appealing. And that makes sense to me when I think about it. The kind of people I get along with are the ones who also like words. Whose hearts are moved by poetry, who seek the perfect word to sparkle, to make clear, to inspire. 
<br />
<br />If I'd started my interviews thinking rigidly of the service I wanted to offer, I probably wouldn't have discovered that. It's scary in a way, because I can see that the service I'm evolving is going to be a lot deeper, and more collaborative, than I'd at first thought. It's exciting - I can tell that we're going to be working together in new ways, co-creating something vulnerable and truly authentic. Something that hasn't been written before.
<br />
<br />The next stage is scary - pulling together a little package that I think is what people are looking for, and then testing it - seeing how it lands. Refining, revising, editing it down. But I've felt enough flow to know I'm on the right track. My advice for anyone thinking of doing research? Do it. Be open. Be curious. You never know where it might lead you...
