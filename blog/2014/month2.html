                <p class="lead">So, month two of freelance life. The milestone came and went and I barely noticed it. Time feels like it’s sped up, somehow. 
</p> 
<p>I want to tell you today about something I haven’t come across, really, in my endless <strike> procrastination</strike> research into how to have a joyful and productive freelance life. 
<br />
<br />And that is: doing less. Skiving off, playing hooky, taking a holiday. 
<br />
<br />A holiday? Three months into going freelance? What am I talking about?
<br />
<br />OK, so not a real holiday.  Come on now. I still did my client work, submitted my invoices, crossed things off my to do list. But one of the reasons I wanted to go self employed in the first place was to gain a bit more freedom. Not to be tied to one place, one office, one computer. This is 2014! We’re all in the cloud now!
<br />
<br />So, a couple of weeks ago, my beloved had some time off work, and our beautiful friends offered us the use of their flat in London for a few days. A holiday in our hometown. The forecast was sunny, and I was hungry for bakeries and decent coffee and restaurants. My work could come with me!
<br />
<br />I packed my laptop and my charger, my notebooks and my phone, and I got ready for a bit of nomadic working. Location independent as they call it on those live-your-dream-marketing websites. I figured it’d be good practice for our adventure this summer. And actually, travelling is good practice anyway. It makes you ask yourself “what do I really need?” In the process of packing I got rid of plenty of not-so-important bits of paper and whittled it down to a bag’s worth of stuff.
<br />
<br />And I turned my approach to work on its head. Instead of asking ‘what’s the most I can do today to help my business grow?’ I asked myself ‘what’s the least I can do to keep my clients happy?’
<br />
<br />Instead of working at my predetermined times, my schedule, I followed the rhythm of our day. Started a bit later, finished a bit earlier. 
<br />
<br />Only two days in London. And then again, the next weekend. We stayed in Northumberland - wide open skies and big cold sandy beaches, and refreshed ourselves with long countryside walks to crumbling castles. We travelled back on Easter Monday and again, I compressed my plans for the day into the shortest amount of time. 
<br />
<br />This week I’ve been back on the productivity wagon. Goal setting, early starts, starting to enjoy long uninterrupted stretches of two, three hours' work in the mornings. But going away shook things up just enough to keep it interesting. To remind me of what’s most important, what’s my lzer-focus, and what’s just padding. And some things, that don’t pay the bills but feed my soul - like writing - are, it turns out, just as essential. 
<br />
<br />So, in month two I learned: to do better work, try doing less work.
