                <p class="lead">I never used to consider myself as a perfectionist. I thought of myself as someone who perpetually fell short. In my mind, a perfectionist always got it right. 
</p> 
<p>I pictured a small, precise person, like my friend Philippa at primary school, with tiny neat handwriting who always seemed to be clean and on time. I was a gawky, tall child with buck teeth and freckles. Like all kids I would mess up and forget things and when I did I blamed myself. 
</br>
</br>But blaming myself for falling short became something of a habit. I was forever failing to measure up to a standard. And one day, it hit me out of the blue: the standard is perfection. 
</br>
</br>Since going self-employed, I’ve been getting to know my demons one by one. It's important for any business owner, self employed or not. It’s certainly an important process if you want to be a writer. We do better when we look honestly at our characteristics, our faults and flaws and talents. 
</br>
</br>
The worst part of perfectionism is not knowing it’s a thing and just feeling generally inadequate. Naming it, recognising it, takes away some of its sting. 
And I want to go further, to learn to get along with it. To invite it round for tea. 
</br>
</br>“Perfectionism!” I’ll say, when I feel that nag, that ache. When I sit down to edit my work, write two words and delete three, and end up with a blank page. Instead of running scared from it, I’ll welcome it in. “So great to see you! I’m glad you’re here. This is important.”
</br>
</br><h4>Perfectionism is connected to creating.</h4> 
</br>The feeling you get of wanting to change things. Of finding a word that fits a little better. Of adjusting the layout of the room so that the energy flows just so. Of tweaking the harmony up or down a semi-tone to give the song that edge it needs. It nibbles at me like a fish. Just one more revision. Just five more minutes. 
</br>
</br>The challenge is to learn to let go. A couple of years ago, I went on a retreat, a whole weekend of seated meditation in one of the remotest parts of England. I don't know what I imagined it would be; I was only just starting to explore meditation, and I guess I thought I was ready for some kind of test. The perfectionist in me loves a test. I signed up and caught the train at dawn. 
</br>
</br>
It was… hard. Three almost-silent days, when I sat and listened to the monsters of my own mind boil and rampage and howl, with no one else to blame them on. It was a fascinating and horrifying process, in equal measure. I’d like to say that I emerged free and clean; honestly, I returned home in turmoil, washed by a strange mixture of euphoric clarity and utter despair. It took me a while to heal and I like to think I’ll go back one day and do it again.
</br>
</br>While I was there we did a couple of hours work. We spoke only what had to be spoken. I was painting walls in a recently refurbished building. And one of the things which the monks impressed on us straight away, was that you start when you start, and you finish when you finsih. No "Just one more thing". When the bell rings, you stop, and you go on to your next activity. 
</br>
</br>That’s the hard part. Being a perfectionist is awesome when you’re in the flow. Assessing what needs doing, fixing it, looking again. I could do that all day. The hard part is walking away. Knowing when to say “Well, perfectionism, it’s been great to see you. We’ve got so much done. See you around.”
