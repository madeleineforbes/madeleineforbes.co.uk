                <p class="lead">A <a href="http://youinspireme.co.uk/support-and-resources/community/" target="blank">smart woman</a> once said, "Just because it's called self-employment doesn't mean it has to be by-your-self-employment". 
</br>
</br>
Maybe it's no coincidence that I wound up working with someone whose mission is to make self-employment sustainable, profitable and most importantly, sane. Four months in and I want to talk about one of the most important things about being self-employed, and that's this: You don't have to do it on your own. 
</p> 
<p>Now, it's obvious to me that having someone else onside can make a huge difference to your business. That's what I provide, after all: Support that allows entrepreneurs and small business owners to focus on what really matters to them - to stay in their Zone of Genius - while I take care of the day to day communications, those niggling bits of research, the updates to sites that make the difference between connection and confusion for prospective clients. 
</br>
</br>It took me a while, however, to realize just how important having that support was for <em>me</em>. My business hasn't yet got to the size where I need to take someone on to be a part of my business, even for a few hours of support a week. I love working solo and I'm happy organizing my workflow, curating my website and getting things done day to day. 
</br>
</br>
But after my first few months of self-employment, I started to notice something. Nick would come home from work, tired out and wanting to chill. "Hey, boo," he'd say. "How was your day?".  
</br>
</br>
And I'd leap up from the kitchen table like a mad lady and tell him... everything. The emails I'd sent, the calls I'd had. How I'd spoken to someone who I thought might be a new client and how things worked out on that project that was going on and my energy took a dip at lunchtime but now I have a great plan in place for tomorrow and and and...
</br>
<h4>Everyone needs a team</h4>
It was the kind of stuff I'd offload to my colleagues, back when I worked in an office. Sometimes I'd have questions that I didn't know how I would solve, and I'd run them past my housemates or the cat or my Mum, but there was a really a limit to the kind of advice I could get. 
</br>
</br>
It was a bit like when I started to write seriously, a few years ago. I learned eventually that what I needed was someone else who was doing what I was doing. Who'd be interested in the way I'd solved a particular problem, who'd cheer me on through the sorrow of realising that a character was woefully two-dimensional and help me think through the ramifications of a change in Point-of-View half way through. 
</br>
</br>
My <a href="http://shakeguacandroll.com/" target="blank">writing</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/PenEnvy" target="blank">buddies</a> were my shoulders to cry on when I thought I wasn't getting anywhere, and they're still my greatest supports for whatever my latest project is (a book about my cycle journey, since you ask). 
</br>
</br>
And now, I'm assembling my team of self-employment support too, to guide me through these unfamiliar waters, and hold my hand when things get rough. 
</br>
<h4>Who do you need?</h4>
Everyone's different, of course. My first self-employment buddy - someone who wasn't already a friend, who I met soley by taking that leap - was <a href="http://leasheartart.com/" target="blank">Lea</a>. For the past couple of months we've been Skyping almost daily, checking in for twenty minutes or so to share our goals and catch up on progress. We're "accountability buddies". 
</br>
</br>When I tell Lea I want to write tomorrow, she asks "How many words?". When I tell her I've had a great idea for a client, she says "And when will you do it by?". Having someone to hold me accountable to my ideas, to remind me of what I've achieeved when I've had a bad day, to make suggestions for my productivity: it's priceless.  
</br>
</br>
And Lea being Lea, she's come up with her own totally unique and creative way to support me to be more organised. There's a clue in the picture at the top; I'm going to share more about the productivity system we've devised in my next post. 
</br>
</br>
Next on my support team list? Help with relocation and independent working. I'm moving to Portugal in August, and it's exciting - and scary. What's it going to be like living in a foreign country, away from my friends and family, and to run a business while I'm at it? I reached out to two amazing people to give me some support on my journey. <a href="http://www.minestronesoul.com/" target="blank">Jo Bradshaw</a> is a creative wizard who also happens to live on a smallholding in rural Bulgaria. Connecting with Jo helped me see that anything's possible. That you can be fulfilled in digital work while still making time to get your hands muddy, and that location independent working means more than working in Starbucks. 
</br>
</br>
<a href="http://www.creativelydonebygina.com/" target="blank">Gina Palha</a> is another inspirational being with a gorgeously quirky style. Seeing as we're both in the business of providing bespoke virtual assistance, you might think there'd be an element of... dare I say it... <em>competition</em> in the mix. Well, you'd be wrong. As Gina is Portuguese I took a deep breath and reached out to ask for a chat and she shared so generously some beautiful tips on Portugal, her own advice on strategies for remote-working sanity, AND put me in touch with <a href="http://www.thebootstrapva.com/" target="blank">The Bootstrap VA</a> - a super practical, nuts and bolts guide to all kinds of virtual services.
</br>
</br>
Along with friends who've also taken the self-employment leap - like Penelope of <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/littlenomadlondon">Little Nomad</a> - building this support team has been invaluable in allowing me to feel comfortable with my business, and to bring my best work to my clients. I know that without them I'd be lost, uncertain and filled with doubts, and I'm grateful to have found such inspirational models to help support me growing my little business.
</br>
</br>
The biggest lesson I've learned? People are busy, sure, but they want to help. All you have to do is ask. So who's on your team? Who couldn't you do your solo work without?
