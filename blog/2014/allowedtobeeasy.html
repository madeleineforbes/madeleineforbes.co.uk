                <p class="lead">It's been a summer of change. We moved out to Portugal at the start of August and I made the conscious choice to let my business rest. To embrace what was there and not try to change it. Now, I'm ready to come back into this space, and to take the next step that's needed in my work. 
</p> 
<p>
Iâ€™ve been blogging about our adventures on the farm <a href="http://quintadias.com/" target="blank">here</a>, because it didn't feel right to fill this space with lizards and rainstorms. Besides, things really did slow down. In July I wrapped up the extra projects I had going on, including an editing job that I'd loved, paring my work back down to my regular clients.
<br />
<br />
To be honest, I was preparing for a rough ride. Maybe a sketchy internet connection or a hardware disaster during the move. I was grateful for clients who knew what I was doing, who trusted me and who I trusted. I thought that would hopefully be enough to carry us over any unexpected disruptions. 
<br />
<br />
<h4>The surprise</h4>
<br />
In the end, the biggest surprise of all was how smoothly it went. I'm up and running in my new office, pictured above, and less than a week after we arrived I was Skypeing a client and answering emails like nothing had changed. 
<br />
<br />It was a huge reminder of one of my favourite mantras: "Allow it to be easy". Life doesn't have to be hard. The worst case scenario doesn't always happen. The sense of groundedness, the peace I've felt as my life aligned with my values - low-impact, wildness, simplicity, adventure - has seen me through the few hiccups with grace and humour. When I look out at the mountains I feel like this is the decision I was always meant to make.<br />
<br />
Coming out of my semi-sabbatical, I've hit the autumn ready to take a deep look at my business, and excited to see where I'm ready to grow. One thing I did do over the summer was to take on a couple of writing projects for friends, helping them put their product or workshop into words. And it was totally joyful, and flowed with total ease, and I loved it.<br />
<br />
<h4>Following the thread</h4>
<br />
Women I'm in awe of for their creative, healing skills - ceramics, or Bowen therapy or Shamanic teaching - wanted me to try and put their magic into words, and I was so happy to do so. I was able to connect with them and create words that matched their vision and I loved it. <br />
<br />
I'm back in the UK right now and feeling this strong pull to see where this takes me, this play. It scares me a little, if I'm honest. I don't want to turn my business on its head or lose the clients I have or move on to something completely different. And I don't want to lose the joy and the freedom to create beautiful words. 
<br />
<br />
Writing is such a personal, sacred process for me, I'm scared to put it into the world. But it's time. 
<br />
<br />
I want to dive a little deeper into discovering how the expression I enjoy - in words - can actually serve others to share their work, their art, with the world. 
<br />
<br />
<h4>Let's talk</h4>
<br />
So. I'm starting off gently, with a research project. 10 interviews, 10 heart-to-heart connections to help me find out whether this is something that could be of service.
<br />
<br />
If you love what you do but find that when you come to write about it all the magic disappears, then I'd love to get to know you. <a href="research.html">Click here to find out more</a>. And I'll be offering a thank you gift to those ten people I speak with, so if writing is something you struggle with, you won't want to miss out.
