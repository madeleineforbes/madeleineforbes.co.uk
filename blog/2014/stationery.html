                <p class="lead">When I told them I was quitting my desk job to go self-employed, people told me “Make the most of the stationery cupboard!”</p>

<p>I remember the first one I ever saw, when I interned at New Woman magazine just before I finished school. I was sixteen and the magazine office was impossibly glamorous. Jo Elvin, now Glamour editor, was at the helm and I got to run across the road into Covent Garden, and buy her coffees and toast with peanut butter. There was a radio playing music in the office, and wine from plastic cups on Fridays. 
</p> 
<p>It was the first time I ever saw something I’d written in print. I wrote tiny little captions for a collection of “boy’s toys” - binoculars and other gadgets - and the writer I was assigned to laughed and  left them in. It seemed like heaven and at the same time, that seemed to mean that it didn’t qualify as a proper job. Things might have been different if I knew then what I knew now. 
</p> 
<p>But before I gritted my teeth and waved goodbye to writing witty captions for sexist features, I learned about the stationery cupboard. Emap was still doing pretty well then and this one was a doozy. Tucked away by the mailroom downstairs, with tall metal shelves and its own distinctive scent. The idea of having a special room where you could help yourself to what ever you wanted? This was the icing on the cake. 
</p> 
<p>In a way, it’s things like the stationery cupboard that give us the illusion of freedom. Even if the job is boring, or stressful, or requires missing out on sunny days and staying into the evening to meet deadlines. There’s the IT department to fix our computers and the cupboard full of all the pens and paper and a salary in our bank accounts at the end of the month. Life is predictable and safe. Whatever we do or don’t do during the day, we come and sit at the desk, and listen to our voicemail and say hello to the security guards and life is peachy. 
</p> 
<p>Except that knowing, nagging feeling in our stomachs that tells us it isn’t alright, not really. That little voice in the back of our minds asking “Is this it?”. That distant knowledge that everything we do, everything we learn is for someone else, some other agenda. And if one day it’s time to be outsourced or rationalised or streamlined, never mind the pay rises and the bonuses and the hand on the shoulder after the interview, it’ll only be us on that side of the table. 
</p> 
<p>So I jumped. I guess I had an advantage. What with my hoarding habits and<a href="http://www.wittytitlehere.com/2013/02/writing-is-craft/" target="blank"> love of pen and paper</a> I’ve got enough pens and pencils to last me a lifetime. I’m working my way through the notebooks I’ve bought over the years and getting some new ones too. And even better, for the first time I’m actually getting creative with the systems I use for work. I’ve long known in my bones that organising your work, the process of productivity, is an art, not a science. And that starts with the stationery. 
</p> 
<p>Each client has their own pages, a sacred space in which I gather ideas and store notes and reconnect with their message, with their voice. Instead of the dry, lined diary I wrote Departmental deadlines in at Cambridge University, I’ve made my own. Hand drawn, with wobbly lines and uneven days, it expresses perfectly my joy that I’m inventing the world I work in myself. 
</p> 
<p>I create handmade systems for individuals. Because we don’t all have to use the same regulation notebook, or the same cheap bic biros. We can treat ourselves to pens that make us smile to use them, we can draw our own schedules, we can frame our work however we want. 
</p> 
<p>Although my work’s online, my brain won’t be filtered through a keyboard. If a particular logistical problem is bugging me, I’ll journal about it, free flowing. It’s as though I need to feel the space that exists in the pages, a reminder that thoughts and creativity are abundant and there are no edges to them.
</p> 
<p>And when I circle back to the boundaries of the problem that’s foxed me, it’ll slip into place. Whether because of the outside-the-box thinking, or because I’ve lifted myself away from the problem, who knows. It’s alchemy, the flow between hand and pen and mind, and I know better than to mess with it. 
</p>         
<p>So no, I don’t miss the stationery cupboard, not really.
</p> 
<p>I built my own.
