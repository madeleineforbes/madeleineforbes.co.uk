                <p class="lead">One month into full-time self employment, and it’s been a journey. </p>

<p>The first couple of weeks I bounced around the house, feeling like any minute I'd wake up from this amazing dream. I get to do what I want all day, and my hard work is rewarded directly by the people I’m helping? Woo hoo! 
</p>
<p>
Then it got bad. I started waking with a clutch of dread in my stomach that I couldn’t shake. A cloud of existential anxiety overtook me, roughly translating to “I’m rubbish, I’m a failure, I’ll never make it, no one will ever want to hire me, I’m the worst person in the world.” 
</p>
<p>
This week, maybe it was the sunshine, but something shifted. I started to feel ground beneath my feet. Part of what helped me was learning from what others have done, and it was awesome reading back through the archives of one of my heroes, Kathleen, to read her <a href="http://andkathleen.com/2011/06/1-year-freelance/">diaries of starting out</a>. So, inspired by her words, these are the things self-employment has taught me so far:
</p>
<p>
</br>
<h4>1. Procrastination is a virtue.</h4>
</br>
I work best when I don’t feel like I’m working. Now that I set my own hours, I can choose what I spend my time on. My over-developed sense of responsibility means I trust that I'll always get the job done. 
</p>
<p>
Instead of beating myself up when I switch tasks I’m learning to loosen my grip on the “shoulds” and think of the things I need to do as a kind of menu that I can pick from in each moment. There’s enough for me to do - emails for my different clients, consultations, skype calls, reading and learning, my different writing projects - that I can happily mix it up and avoid boredom. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, if I convince myself I’m skiving off doing one task and do something else on my list in the process, then I basically feel like I’m playing all day long. 
</br></br>
</p>
<p>  
<h4>2. Get the basics right.</h4>
</br>
Right now I’m wearing multiple layers, a woolly hat, leg warmers and my sheepskin slippers. I might look insane, but when my core is warm and I can feel my fingers, I’m in a much calmer place to do work. 
</p>
<p>
Same goes for the other basics. Turns out, I get better stuff done quicker when I’ve eaten more than one slice of toast all day, moved my body and been outside, and haven’t been chained to the desk whilst holding my breath and needing a wee for  two hours. Ditto staying hydrated. Pints and pints of non caffeinated tea, plus my sacred morning coffee, keep my brain working and fingers typing. 
</br></br>
</p>
<p>
<h4>3. Fake it.</h4> 
</br>
In 2011, my partner and I did a huge, three month cycle tour, through Spain and into Morocco. For about the first two weeks, I felt like a total fraud. When people asked us what we were doing, we’d say “cycling to Marrakesh” and they’d be so impressed! And actually, all we’d done was a few days’ cycling. We were underprepared, cold and a lot of the time I was miserable and exhausted. 
</p>
<p>
But after a while, I started getting used to it. Enough miles passed that I was able to recognise what I’d learned, and absorb it into my identity. 
</p>
<p>
Same with self-employment. Gradually I’m able to tell people that I offer online business support and editing services without feeling the need to add on “but I’ve just started out… this is kind of an experiment… I’m kind of learning as I go". Finally I’m getting to the point where I’ve been helpful to enough people that I can trust in my ability to make their lives easier. Fake it til you make it, right?
</br></br>
</p>
<p>
<h4>4. Remember why.</h4>
</br>
This summer, we’re planning to up sticks and move thousands of miles across Europe to central Portugal. Our dream is to buy a little place in the mountains and build a smallholding there. I’m stupendously excited at the prospect of being able to combine writing, editing and community-building with getting my hands dirty, growing my own food and living a truly sustainable lifestyle. It feels a bit like when I discovered salted caramel. How can a combination so good even be POSSIBLE?
</p>
<p>
This work isn’t just to pay the bills - it’s what I love. I get really excited about solving problems and helping people communicate with their clients better. I love writing and creating copy, and a nice juicy editing job - improving someone else’s text - is my idea of heaven. 
</p>
<p>
On days when the overwhelm gets too much, I take a deep breath and remind myself of that. 
</br></br>
</p>
<p>
<h4>5. Be a good boss.</h4>
</br>
I’m a good employee. I always turn up for work, often stay later than I’m required, and put 100% into the work I do. I own up to my mistakes, pay attention to detail, and remain cheerful whatever happens. 
</p>
<p>
But as a boss, at least as the boss of myself, I suck. (I know <a href="http://www.sarahjbray.com/blog/2011/12/my-90-minute-workday">I'm not the only one</a>). I focus on the negative. I’m demanding, and expect nothing less than 100% perfect, every time. If I think about clocking off, Boss will say hey, you’re not going before you’ve responded to that email, are you? How about that thing that’s been on your to do list for three days? 
</p>
<p>
The people I’ve loved working for in the past had high standards, but were always understanding when an error slipped in. They looked at the big picture when a detail went wrong. They were happy to take time out to review my priorities or discuss a particularly tricky issue, and they knew that maintaing good boundaries between work and home was key to making sure I was mentally restored and ready for action. 
</p>
<p>
So I know I need to work on being the kind of boss I love. 
</p>
<p>
Here’s to the next month, and the lessons it brings…
