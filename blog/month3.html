                <p class="lead">It’s what everyone loves to talk about - the Big Why. Why did I go freelance? What led me down this route?
</br>
</br>
Three months in, I’m starting to feel this urge to come out. To speak more about the truth behind my dreams, and what I want to do with them. 
</br>
</br>
See, even before going freelance, I knew that I wasn’t after a conventional life. I like adventure too much. 

</p> 
<p>I’ve done some travelling, which always helps to clarify things, and there are certain things I know I love. Things like sunshine, going barefoot, eating vegetables from the garden. I like getting my hands dirty, getting down in the soil. I very much enjoy long days where I end up tired and grubby and feel I have something to show for my efforts. 
</br>
</br>A few years ago, I had the opportunity to stay with some friends doing just that. In fact, I spent four months there, in the mountains of Central Portugal. I helped build things and dig things and solve problems like “how do we keep four kittens from being munched by the fox when we don’t have any doors or walls on our house?” (you put them in their very own tent), “how do we water the garden when the well has run dry?” (you set up a system involving pumps and hoses from the river) and “how long is it actually possible to sleep in a tent for?” (four months, happily. Camping’s easy when it doesn’t get cold!). 
</br>
</br>
Needless to say, it was an amazing summer. I cut my own hair. I didn’t wear clothes much. I cooked the most delicious of meals for the hungriest of friends from the freshest of ingredients. The photo above is precious to me; it’s a night I spent all on my own, at our friend’s farm, and in which I felt nothing but peace. I slept in the yurt with only the mice for company and all around I heard the murmurings of the woods and the river and I was whole. 
</br>
</br>
I connected with a part of myself I thought I’d lost, a part of me that was recovering from corporate life, from a life of shoes and buses and degree certificates. It set the wheels in my mind turning. I didn’t want it to end. 
</br>
</br>
<h4>Returning to reality</h4>
And of course it did end; well, that part of the journey came to a close. We returned to the UK to find new friends, and to earn money, and to think about The Rest Of Our Lives. And always with this one question in our minds: how could we return? How would it be possible to move back to those magical mountains, to the star-filled skies and sparkling river, to maybe one day create our own dream?
</br>
</br>
It’s impossible, I thought. But I had this new-found strength in me. So then I said: I’ll try anyway. 
</br>
</br>
Two and a half years on and I’ve done a lot more exploring. I’ve figured out some of the things I missed while I was away building walls and planting seeds. I missed the thrill of communication; I missed the web, if I’m honest. Missed connecting with people and sharing ideas across the world. And I missed being a part of a team, or working with people to create projects and communities that could change lives. 
</br>
</br>
This little business I’ve set up over the past three months meets those needs admirably. It’s stretching me and changing me in ways I hadn’t thought possible. I’m learning new things every day, and learning is one of my absolute favourite things in the whole world. 
</br>
</br>
<h4>You never stop growing</h4>
And yet, this is only part of the story. Because now I’ve taken the leap into this freelance life, I’m ready to take the next step too. To take a deep breath and pack up my laptop and my belongings and head out once more into the wild, into the land of vast blue skies and tall green mountains, of delicious coffee and sweet cinnamon pastries, and see if I can find where I left off. 
</br>
</br>
Today, I bought ferry tickets, and over the next couple of months the work will start in earnest for us to relocate to Portugal. Creating this business has been like building my own engine, an outboard motor to drive us out into the big blue sea. I'm so proud and fulfilled by what I've achieved; so inspired to help others achieve their dreams too, and to be a part of that with love and support and lots and lots of laughter. 
</br>
</br>
I look at my list of clients and it amazes me, truly, that I’ve found such inspiring, smart, funny people to work with. That I’ve got just the right amount of work to keep my heart and my mind full, and not so much that I won’t have time to sit in the garden and sniff the air and know that life is good.

So that’s my why, and it’s also my how. I’d love to have some company on this path that’s new to me, and there are bound to be some good stories in the months to come. Are you following me on twitter? <a href="https://twitter.com/mforbes_" target="blank">Come on over and say hi</a>. What impossible dreams have you made real in your life?

</br>
To adventure!
