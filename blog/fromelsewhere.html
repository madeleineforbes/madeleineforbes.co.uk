                <p class="lead">The last time I felt like this, on the edge of something, it was January 2011. A cold winter. Thick snow fell; I remember a magical day in Richmond Park; pristine fields of pillowy white snow. We sledged on pilfered estate agents’ signs and walked through silent copses. And all the time I knew that everything was about to change.
</p> 
<p>
I’d lived in London since graduating, winding up with a local authority job in Hammersmith in a dilapidated office near Ravenscourt tube. I loved cycling to meetings at schools around the borough, from leafy streets around the Chelsea football ground, to the vast White City estate by JG Ballard’s beloved westway. 
<br />
<br />
I loved getting coffees from the Italian deli where the owner knew our names, the view from our flat of streets lined with cherry trees, of planes circling as they queued for runways at Heathrow. The big squawking flocks of parakeets, the smell of the brewery on warm evenings, the nature reserve at Barnes and Hammersmith bridge at sunset. 
<br />
<br />
I loved it and I was tired of it, too. My job was equal parts rewarding and crazy-making; for everyone who said “you’ve changed my life, thank you” someone else told me I was a useless waste of taxpayer’s money and had ruined their kid’s life forever. This is what it’s like working in education, and I was starting to wonder if I was cut out for it. Promotion meant getting further away from the connections I made each day, with amazing parents and their inspiring kids, towards spreadsheets and a fancy office. Pay rises ebbed away on fancy coffees and rent on the view of the cherry trees, and I didn’t want more money anyway. 
<br />
<br />
I wanted more of… something else. The rumblings among my peers of mortgages and deposits grew louder along with a thirst for something bigger and wilder and freer than late dinners and the perfect sushi place, the perfect Thai. 
<br />
<br />
<h4>So it began</h4>
<br />
Someone asked me recently how we came up with the idea of going on our bikes, and I didn’t really have a very satisfactory answer. I liked cycling. Coming home on summer evenings I sometimes used to take detours up and down quiet suburban streets, aimlessly. 
<br />
<br />
I remember very distinctly cycling into work one morning on a bright blue-skied day and thinking: I wish I didn’t have to stop. I could just ride all day, on a day like this. And at some point we started talking about doing just that. An adventure where we’d carry our belongings with us, stop where we wanted, power ourselves with our own legs. 
<br />
<br />
If you google cycle touring - this comes with a health warning - you’ll see how easy it was to fall in love.
<br />
<br />
A plan formed. We’d take the ferry to Spain and head south from Santander, and when we hit the coast we’d take another boat, and then we’d be in Africa. And we’d keep going. 
<br />
<br />
By January we’d moved out of the lovely flat and into a studio behind a newsagents, which lacked central heating or a bath tub but allowed us to squirrel away our pennies, to invest in a solar powered phone charger, the worlds most lightweight tent, waterproof panniers and maps. I’d started writing a novel, feeling as though I was waking from a strange dream, feeling an eleven-year old’s certainty of the possibilities of life, of all the people I might be, all the things I might do, when I left my school-university-job chrysalis and did something different. 
<br />
<br />
I didn’t know how hard it would be, or how much it would change me, those miles and miles of foreign roads, those hills, those campsites. 
<br />
<br />
<h4>This is now</h4>
<br />
That was three years ago, and now I’m also getting ready. There’s a battered landrover parked on the driveway, and we’ve called her Brenda. We’re putting things in boxes and shedding the stuff we don’t need, and again I am booking a ferry ticket to Santander, and I didn’t have to quit my job this time. I did that a few months ago, actually. Now the work travels with me, work for inspiring, intelligent, visionary women who I’m honoured to be able to support building their sparks and candles into huge bonfires to light the sky. 
<br />
<br />
We’re heading to Portugal, which was where our cycle journey ended and another journey began. We’ll be staying in a house we helped build; we’ll be chopping and digging and planting and nurturing new things. We’re giving up electricity and running water and telly, and gaining sunlight and fresh air and this view while we drink our morning coffee. Who knows how long we'll be there or whether the nomadic itch will strike again. 
<br />
<br />
I’ve been telling these stories to family and friends for three years now and I’m taking another leap now, too. I want to start sharing some of the things I’ve seen and learned. To tell you how I got to this place, because I want you to come with me. It’s time to open up, to let the light pour in and share the treasures I have found, and speak the truths I discovered. 
<br />
<br />
<h4>An invitation</h4>
<br />
So this is an invitation. If you’d like to be a part of this new adventure, <a href="http://eepurl.com/Z8n15" target="blank">click here to leave your name and email address</a>. I want us to get to know each other better. I’ll send you stories of the places I’ve been and the things that I’ve seen, and at the start of August, I’ll be telling it as it happens.
