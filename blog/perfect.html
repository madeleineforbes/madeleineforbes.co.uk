                <p class="lead">I never thought of myself as a perfectionist through most of my teens and twenties. I thought of myself instead as someone who always fell short. In my mind, a perfectionist was someone who always got it right. 
</p> 
<p>I pictured a small, precise person, like my friend Philippa at primary school, with tiny neat handwriting who always seemed to be clean and on time. I was a gawky, tall child with buck teeth and freckles, perpetually late. Like all kids I would mess up and forget things and when I did I blamed myself. 
</br>
</br>It only took me 3 decades to realise that blaming myself for falling short had morphed into something of a habit. I was forever failing to measure up to my own standards. And one day, it hit me out of the blue: My own standard? It’s perfect. Nothing less will do. 
</br>
</br>My name’s Madeleine Forbes and I am a perfectionist.
</br>
</br>Since turning self-employed, I’ve been getting to know my demons one by one. I don’t think this is especially narcisstic (though I’m never averse to a bit of self help). I think that it’s actually an important process for any business owner, self employed or not. It’s certainly an important process if you want to be a writer. As humans, we do better when we look honestly at our characteristics, our faults and flaws and talents. The worst part of perfectionism is not knowing it’s a thing and just feeling generally inadequate. Naming it, recognising it, takes away some of its sting. 
</br>
</br>And my next project is to try and learn to get along with it. To invite it round for tea. 
</br>
</br>“Perfectionism!” I’ll say, when I feel that nag, that ache, that it’s not right. Like when I sit down to edit my work, write two words and delete three, and end up with a blank page. No, instead of giving into it, I’ll welcome it in. “So great to see you! I’m glad you’re here. This piece really means a lot to me and I know you’ll give me that final push to make it better.”
</br>
</br><h4>Because perfectionism isn’t just a negative thing.</h4> 
</br>It’s actually a lot to do with creating. If you like to make art - whatever the media - then you know the feeling you get of wanting to change things. Of finding a word that fits a little better. Of adjusting the layout of the room so that the energy flows just so. Of tweaking the harmony up or down a semi-tone to give the song that edge it needs. Alex Franzen related her art to OCD and I tie mine to this perfectionist impulse. It nibbles at me like a fish. Just one more change. Just one more revision. Just five more minutes. 
</br>
</br>The challenge is to learn to let go. A couple of years ago, I went on a retreat at a Soto Zen monastery in Northumberland. A whole weekend of seated meditation and temple ritual in stark, wild countryside in one of the remotest parts of England. I don't know what I imagined it would be; I was only just starting to dip a toe into Zen and meditation, and I guess I thought I was ready for some kind of test. The perfectionist in me loves a test. Driven by ego, by a desire to prove something to myself, to be a certain kind of person, I signed up and caught the train at dawn. 
</br>
</br>
It was… hard. Three almost-silent days, when I sat and listened to the monsters of my own mind boil and rampage and prowl, with no one else to blame them on. It was a fascinating and horrifying process, in equal measure. I’d like to say that I emerged free and clean; honestly, I returned home in turmoil, washed by a strange mixture of euphoric clarity and utter despair. It took me a while to heal and I like to think I’ll go back one day and meet my demons again.
</br>
</br>While I was there we did a couple of hours work, in the monastery. We met and spoke only what needed to be spoken. I was painting walls in a recently refurbished building. And one of the things which the monks impressed on us straight away, was that you start when you start, and you finish when you finsih. No "Just one more thing". When the bell rings, you stop, and you go on to your next activity. 
</br>
</br>That’s the hard part. Being a perfectionist is kind of fun when you’re in the flow. Assessing what needs doing, fixing it, assessing again. I could do that all day and that’s the trouble: I wouldn't eat, or move my body, or show any loving. The hard part is walking away. Knowing when to say “Well, perfectionism, it’s been great to see you. We’ve got so much done in the last hour, and I couldn’t be more grateful for all your input. But I actually have other things to be getting on with. We can resume this later?”
</br>
</br>That’s my challenge for this week. I have a full to do list and a lot of prioritising, and I need to be smart with my time.
