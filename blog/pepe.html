                <p class="lead">This is Pepe. He’s a cat who lives in the same house as me. Since going freelance, observing what he does with his day has brought me a useful perspective on self employment. Here are the four main things he's taught me: 
</p> 
<p><h4>1. Only do what you need to do. </h4>
</br>
The picture above represents a good 70% of Pepe's daylight hours. He comes in, pesters whoever's in the kitchen for breakfast, sometimes demands to be petted or fussed a bit. Thn he finds a good spot - on the end of a bed, or on the seat of a chair pushed under the kitchen table - curls up, and snoozes. For hours. He'll acknowledge me if I wake him up - a sleepy miaow, a stretch, perhaps a shift in position - but that's it. 
</br>
</br>I never see Pepe looking like he doesn’t know what to do next and, I don't imagine he spends any time worrying about whether his time is being spent productively. When he has stuff to do (catching small animals, watching birds in trees, enjoying some human affection) he just does it. When he doesn’t have stuff to do, he sleeps. It’s a super efficient way to use his energy. 
</br>
</br>And it’s something I need reminding of sometimes, when I’m casting around for something to worry about so that I can feel I’ve had a productive day. It’s easy to become a little bit addicted to that adrenaline-fulled “busy” feeling. Pepe’s taught me that I can trust myself to rest and regenerate in the quiet times. 
</br></br></p> 
<p><h4>2. Work at your best times</h4>
</br>
Pepe sleeps all day. But I don’t think he’s lazy. At dawn and dusk, he’s out and about, doing his thing. I notice the difference in the seasons, as well. Through the winter, when the days were short, both of the cats spent a lot of time indoors, sleeping. As spring approached they were in the garden more and more, hunting, honing their skills on beetles and bees. Observing. 
</br>
</br>I’m still figuring out my best times to work, and sometimes they change. Last night I had a second wind that took me through til 10pm; other days I’m frazzled by 4 and ready to chill out. I spent so much of my working life ignoring the signals from my body (2pm slump, I’m looking at you) that it’s a work in progress to retrain myself to listen to what I need and adjust accordingly. Pepe does it like a pro. 
</br></br></p>
<p><h4>3. Ask for what you need</h4>
</br>
Since I’ve been at home the cats are happy that there’s someone around. At least once a day they’ll come running to whenever I’m working and clamber up on my lap. Butt their heads against me until I relent and stroke them, when they’ll launch into exuberant fits of purring. When they’re done, they’ll leave. Same with food - if they want more, they’ll wind round our ankles and miaow. They don't feel guilty for disturbing me when I'm in the middle of something, or shy about admitting that they can't feed themselves. 
</br>
</br>It’s simple, really. But how often do I struggle alone with something because I’m nervous of saying what it is I want?
</br></br></p>
<h4>4. Be curious</h4>
</br>
One thing I like about cats compared to dogs is that they like to mix it up. Most days Pepe sleeps all day but sometimes he’s gone for hours. If he hears a noise he’ll get up and investigate. He’s not ruled by his routines, because the routines he has are based on how he’s feeling - at least, that’s the way I interpret it. 
</br>
</br>As I start to experiment more with how I do my best work - what time of day? At home or in a cafe? Wearing smart clothes or casual or a jaunty hat? After exercise or before? I remind myself to keep things loose, flexible. I didn’t go self-employed just to set myself a whole new set of rules. This is a different way of living, now.
