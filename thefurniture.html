        He said, why are you building the website anyway? Aren’t there places that already do that for you?</p>

<p>I said, you know those shelves you just made? The ones with the custom spacing, just big enough to slide the decks into?</p> 

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Well, you could have got those shelves from Ikea. They would have come in a flatpack with instructions, and it would have been easy. They would have looked like everyone else’s shelves.</p>

<p>But you made them instead. You salvaged the wood. Drew them up and measured them and send me out to get the extra bits on the High Street, the first day of the year it was warm enough for me to wear shorts, and I can still see the pencil lines on the side where you ruled across the grain with the set square.</p> 

<p>Actually, that pencil line makes me like them more. They fit the space perfectly.</p> 

<p>He said, I’m thinking of adding rollers. So I can slide the decks out when I want to have a mix.</p> 

<p>(Flashback to house parties, 2007-ish. Brush your Shoulders Off, Dogz and Sledgez, and that  Terrorsquad track that was all over Notting Hill the year before: lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back…)</p>

<p>But they’re too low down to mix, I said. You would have to kneel down.</p>

<p>Ah, that’s the beauty. I can switch them around however I want, because they’re custom.</p>

<p>Well, I said, that’s what it’s like on the web. There are loads of places that I could get a site that was easy to build and looked good. Like Ikea, the ready made stuff is simple, stylish, it’s even a little quirky if you can say that about something mass produced. It wouldn’t even be expensive. But now, you’re free.  Instead of the shelves owning you, with instructions and allen keys and bossy little packets of screws, you own them, because you built them with your hands.</p>

<p>That’s what I want with my website. To know how it works, be able to put it up and take it down and do whatever I want.
