      <br />Hi, I'm <a href="about.html">Madeleine Forbes</a>. Thanks for pausing here, now. 
<br />
<br />Today, 11th January 2014, I had a writing date. I met Ava at the station and we went to pick up lunch ingredients. Miso, turnips, avocados. We walked back to the house along the path next to the allotments. Someone had lit a bonfire and smoke was rising into the cold air of this year that still feels brand new to me. <br />
<br />We talked all afternoon about online and offline realities. About how people share everything online except the really big things. Like being scared, or sad, or lonely. About second-guessing your choices in real life because of how they would appear online.
<br />
<br /> We talked about the books we'll write and the people who'll read them and now I'm drinking tea with the cat nagging me and I think I might go back to my draft next week. Might see where the story takes me. 
            <br />

<br />
<br />The Hebrides are a little sliver of islands off the west coast of scotland. The last barrier between the mainland and the wide cold sea. We arrived at night and drove off the ferry down the one main road, a single track winding between lochs and open water, causeways spanning the tides. In the morning we came out of the house and looked around. 
<br />
<br />The island was very wet, and pretty flat, and brown. Tweedy. Like an otter’s coat. Greens and reds and yellow grasses whipped by the constant wind.
<br />
<br />There's not much daylight at the turning of the year, so we lived in a perpetual sunrise/sunset. The colours so intense, dissolving so vividly into each othery. The dark clear water. These islands that are more water than land. The earth itself soggy and saturated, briny water pooling in each footstep. 
<br />
<br />Little flurries of birds, flashes of black and white. Eagles and buzzards and fat round seals basking on the rocks.  
<br />
<br />I thought about the first people who colonised these islands. How they got there, not knowing there was land. The settlers, the pioneers. I find myself called to these edges at the moment, to the fringes of civilisation. Perhaps because I feel in my own life that I am reaching an edge, setting out across a stretch of water.
<br />
 <br />"What the wind brings, the current takes away."
<br />
<br />Crofting. Ancient smallholdings. The lines of seaweed – lazy beds. The seaweed makes the soil alkaline, the peat acid. Somewhere in the balance a living is scratched out.
<br />
<br />The women of Eriskay knitting the jumpers. The sentence about the women singing, the repetitive tasks. I think about the repetitive tasks I do. The catching of buses, the sending of reports and emails. The form letters, the templates.
<br />
<br />In life I like to be the one who provides the unexpected flash of humanity. The personal, the handmade. I like to jolt people out of their low expectations, out of the morass of what we expect and what everyone does. Not to be better. But to be true. To be more me.
<br />
<br />This year, I want to do things slowly. My mantras in January have been "all is well" and "one thing at a time". I’m not being over-ambitious with my resolutions, not trying to make a hundred changes.
<br />
<br />In the dark and the rain, sometimes my practice in the morning is lying in bed, waking up very slowly. Feeling my fingers and toes and my husband breathing next to me. Hearing the rain outside and the dawn chorus and the bang of the catflap. I've been taking my time.
<br />
<br />I do less but I'm doing each thing I do more.  This year, I'm starting at a point where I'm lucky because most of the things I spend my time on I don't want to switch off from. And I want to cultivate that. To become who I am. 
<br />
<br />To building the lives we want. Slowly and lightly. To the wind and the rain and the salt spray. To reaching the edge of the world, wherever that may be.
